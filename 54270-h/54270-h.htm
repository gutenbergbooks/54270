  <h2 class='c003'>The Artfulness of Steggles</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c007'>I</h3>

<p class='c008'>I remember the very evening he came
to Merivale. “Nubby” Tomkins had
a cold on his chest, so Mathers and I
stopped in from the half-hour “kick-about”
in the playground before tea, being chums
of Nubby’s. Whenever he gets a cold on
the chest he thinks he is going to die,
and this evening, sitting by the fire in the
Fifth’s class-room, he roasted chestnuts for
Mathers and me, and took a very gloomy
view of his future life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As you know,” he said, “I hate being
out of doors excepting when I can lie about
in hay. And to make me go out walking
in all weathers, as they do here, is simply
murder. I know what’ll be the end of
it. I shall get bacilluses or microbes into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>some important part of me, and die. It’s
like those books the Doctor reads to the
kids on Sundays, with choir-boys in them.
The little brutes sing like angels, and their
voices go echoing to the top of cathedrals,
and make people blub about in the pews.
Then they get microbes on the chest, and
kick. You know the only thing I can do
is to sing; and I shall die as sure as mud.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nubby was a corker at singing. He had
all the solos in the chapel to himself, and
people came miles to hear him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You won’t die,” said Mathers. “You
don’t give your money away to the poor,
or help blind people across roads, and all
that. Your voice’ll crack, and you’ll live.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish it would,” said Nubby; “I should
feel a lot safer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mine,” continued Mathers, “cracked
when my mustache came.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We looked at him as he patted it. Mathers
was going next term. He had more
mustache than, at least, two of the under-masters,
and once he let Nubby stroke it,
and Nubby said he could feel it distinctly
under the hand.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>“That’s what’s done it with M.,” said
Nubby, looking at Mathers and opening another
gloomy subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mathers got redder, and began peeling a
chestnut.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish I was as certain as you,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“None of us can be certain,” I said;
“but if your voice did go, Nubbs, you’d be
out of the hunt for one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am,” declared Nubby. “Last time I
had a cold in the throat she sent me a little
bunch of grapes by Jane, and a packet of
black currant lozenges; but this time,
though the attack is on my chest, and I
may die, she hasn’t sent a thing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps she doesn’t know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She does. I met her going into the library
yesterday, and I doubled up and
barked like a dog, and she never even said
she was sorry. It lies between you two
chaps now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe you are going strongest just
at present,” said Mathers, critically, to me.
“You came off last Wednesday and kicked
two goals on your own, and she said afterwards
to Browne that she never saw you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>play a bigger game. Then that little beast--Browne,
I mean--sniggered, and made
that noise in his throat, like a sprung bat,
and said he was quite glad he hadn’t kept
you in. That’s how he shows M. what a
gulf there is even between the Fifth and
masters.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The bigger the gulf the better,” I said.
“It would be rough on a decent worm to
put it second to Browne. In my opinion
even a Double-First would be nothing if he
wore salmon-colored ties and elastic-sided
boots; and Browne isn’t a Double-First by
long chalks. He can only teach the kids,
and his desk is well known to be crammed
with cribs of every kind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the matter of M., I may say at once that
she was Milly, Doctor Denham’s youngest
daughter--twelve and a half, fair, blue eyes,
and jolly difficult to please. Somehow the
Fifth always drew her most. The Sixth were
feeble beggars at that time. Two of the ten
wore spectacles, and one was going out to
Africa as a missionary, and used to treat the
Fifth’s class-room as a sort of training-ground
for preaching and doing good. He was called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Fulcher, and the spirit was willing in him,
but the flesh was flabby. We used to assegai
him with stumps, and pretend to scalp him
and boil him and eat him. He said he should
glory in martyrdom really; and Nubbs, who
knows a good deal about eating, used to write
recipes for cooking Fulcher, and post them
to imaginary African kings. But I should
think that to be merely eaten is not martyrdom,
properly speaking. If it is, then everything
we eat, down to periwinkles, must be
martyrs; which is absurd, like Euclid says.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, it got to be a settled idea at Merivale
that M. cared, in a sort of vague way,
for either Nubby, or Mathers, or me, or all
of us. The situation was too uncertain for
anything like real jealousy among us; besides,
we were chums, and had no objection
to going shares in M.’s regard. At football
Mathers and I fought like demons for
Merivale and for M.’s good word; but any
impression we might make was generally
swept away in chapel by Nubby when Sunday
came. He could sing, mind you. It
was like cold water down your spine, and all
from printed music. Besides, he could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>ill, which gave him a pull over Mathers and
me, who couldn’t. To look at, Nubby was
nothing. He had big limbs, but they were
soft as sausages. If you punched him he
didn’t bruise yellow and afterwards black,
but merely turned red and then white again.
Mathers, besides being captain of the First
Footer eleven, had nigger hair, that girls
always go dotty about, and black eyes, and
pretty nearly as much mustache as eyebrow.
As for me, my biceps were the biggest in the
lower school, which isn’t much, of course;
but things like that tell with a girl.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then it was that conversation turned on
Steggles. He was a new boy, due that afternoon.
Hardly had the name passed my lips
when the door opened, and the Doctor’s head
appeared. The next moment a chap followed
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! there are some of the fellows by
the fire,” said the Doctor. “Is that you,
Tomkins? But I needn’t ask.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir,” said Nubby, rising.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are ill-advised, Tomkins, to spend
the greater part of your leisure sitting, as
you do, almost upon the hob. A constitutional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>weakness is thereby increased. This
is Steggles. You will have time for a little
conversation before tea.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Doctor disappeared, and Steggles
came slowly down the room with his hands
in his pockets. There was nothing to indicate
a new boy about him. He had red rims
to his eyes and a spot or two on his face,
chiefly near his nose and on his forehead;
his hair was sandy, and he wore a gold watch-chain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re called Steggles, aren’t you?”
said Nubby, who was an awfully civil chap
in his manners.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I hope you’ll like Merivale.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right in summer-time when there’s
hay. Hate it when I’m ill, which I am now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What can you do?” asked Mathers in
his abrupt way.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can draw,” said Steggles.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Devils.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do one,” said Mathers.</p>

<p class='c000'>He got a piece of <em>Cambridge demi</em> and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>pen and ink. Then Steggles, evidently anxious
to please, sat down, and did as good a
devil as ever I saw. Nubby and I were
greatly pleased.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What else can you do?” said Mathers,
as if such a power to draw devils wasn’t as
much as you could expect from one chap.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can smoke.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cigarettes? So can anybody.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; a pipe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh! where did you learn that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“At Harrow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Steggles started like a guilty thing
and put his hand over his mouth--too late.
A rumor we had heard was proved true.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It would have been sure to get out, and
I don’t care who knows it, for that matter,”
said Steggles, defiantly. “I had to leave
there because I didn’t know enough, and
couldn’t get up higher in the school. I’m
rather backward through not being properly
taught. The teaching at Harrow’s simply
cruel. Not but what I’ve taught myself a
thing or two, mind you. I’m fifteen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at us out of his red-rimmed
eyes, and put me in mind of a ferret I’ve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>got at home. He might have been any age
up to twenty, I thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you play anything?” asked Mathers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The piano.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mathers shivered and Nubby grew excited.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So can I. We’ll do duets,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you like,” said Steggles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the tea-bell rang.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>II</h3>

<p class='c008'>Whole books might be written about
Steggles at Merivale. I heard Thompson
say, after he had been there a week, that it
wasn’t what he didn’t know had rendered
it necessary for Steggles to leave Harrow,
but what he did know. Certainly he had
a great deal of general information about
rum things. He got newspapers by post
concerning sporting matters; he knew an
immense deal about dogs and horses; and
Nubbs, who was a judge, said his piano-playing
surpassed his devil-drawing for sheer
brilliance. Yet, with all these accomplishments,
he only managed to get into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Fourth. As to his smoking, it was certainly
wonderful. And he ate things afterwards
to hide the smell. He had a genius for
wriggling out of rows and for getting them
up between other fellows. He loved to look
on at fighting and knew all the proper rules.
On the whole he was rather a beast, and, if
it hadn’t been for Nubby, Mathers and I
should have barred him. But all I’m going
to tell about now is the hideous discovery
of Steggles and M., and the thing that happened
on the day of the match with Buckland
Grammar School.</p>

<p class='c000'>M. had been very queer for a fortnight--queer,
I mean, with all three of us--which
was unusual. Then, seeing how the cat had
taken to jumping, I tackled her one morning
going through the hall to the Doctor’s
study.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How d’you like Steggles?” I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well. He’s clever,” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He’s fifteen,” I said; “he ought to
know something if he’s ever going to. He’s
only in the Fourth, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re jealous and so is Mathers,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“Jealous of a chap with ferret-eyes! Not
likely,” I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are, though.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not more than Nubbs and Mathers, anyway,”
I said. “It’s off with the old friends
and on with the new, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Steggles knows how to treat a girl. You
might learn manners from him, and so might
the others,” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And also the piano, perhaps?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He plays beautifully.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you seen him play football?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lucky for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Football isn’t everything.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, not since he came; I’ve noticed that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This bitter speech stung M., and her eyes
jolly well flashed sparks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nor singing either,” I went on. “Nubbs
nearly burst himself last Sunday in chapel;
and all the time you were watching Steggles
making a rabbit with his pocket-handkerchief.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll thank you not to interest yourself in
me any more,” she said, “either in chapel
or out of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“All right. I dare say I shall still live,”
I said. “Does that remark apply equally
to Mathers and Nubby, or only to me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To Mathers, yes,” she said. “He’s as
bad as you are. Not to Nubbs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she went.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, there it stood. When I told them
Mathers seemed to think I needn’t have
dragged him in, and Nubbs got clean above
himself with hope, not seeing that he was
really just as much out of it as us. Of
course we chucked Steggles for good and all
then, and told him what we thought of him.
That was when he said something about only
the brave deserving the fair, and Mathers
made him sit down in a puddle for cheeking
him in the playground. Steggles’s eyes
looked like one of his own devils while he
sat there, but he took it jolly quietly at the
time. That got Nubby’s wool off though,
because he supported Steggles, and things
were, in fact, rather difficult all round till
the day of the Buckland Grammar School
match. Buckland was two miles from Merivale,
and most of the team went by train;
but Mathers and I, the day being fine, decided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>to walk; and at the last moment Nubbs
asked if he might come with Steggles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Out of consideration for Nubby we agreed,
and the four of us started on a fine bright
afternoon just after dinner. Mathers and I
had our football things on, of course; Nubbs
was dressed in his usual style, and Steggles,
who used to get himself up tremendously
on half-holidays, wore yellow spats over his
boots, and a sort of white thing under his
waistcoat, and gloves. We had rather more
than half an hour’s walk before us, and hardly
were we out of sight of Merivale when
Steggles pulled out his pipe and lighted it.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>III</h3>

<p class='c008'>The artfulness of Steggles properly begins
here. He knew several things we didn’t.
He knew, for instance, that M. was coming
to the football match, that she was going to
ride her bicycle over on the road by which
we walked, that only the day before he had
quarrelled with her, and that his position
with regard to her was at that hour most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>risky. All these things Steggles well knew,
and we didn’t. So he lighted his pipe with
an air of long practice. The smell was fine,
and he smacked his lips now and then.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nice pouch?” he said, handing me a
velveteen pouch with his initials on it in
green silk.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll bet a girl did that,” said Mathers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a secret,” said Steggles, smiling to
himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he asked very civily if we would care
to join him, explaining that he generally
kept a few spare pipes about him for friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I would if it wasn’t for the match,” said
Mathers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So would I,” I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, my baccy might turn you fellows
up. Perhaps you are wise,” declared Steggles,
puffing away. Then he tried Nubby
with a little cherry-wood pipe, and Nubbs
thought a whiff or two wouldn’t hurt him
and began rather nervously, but gathered
courage as he went on.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I heard my father say once that life without
tobacco would be hell,” said Steggles;
“and I agree with him.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“So do I; it’s very soothing,” said
Nubby.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Mathers burst out. He had been
sulking ever since Steggles hinted that the
contents of his velveteen pouch were too
strong for us.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you think I funk your tobacco you’re
wrong,” Mathers said. “I’ve smoked three
parts of a cigar before to-day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A chocolate one, perhaps?” said Steggles,
but in such a humble, inquiring voice
that Mathers couldn’t hit him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, a tobacco one; and if you’ve got
another pipe I’ll show you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So will I,” I chimed in. Mathers’s lead
was always good enough for me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Steggles immediately lugged out two more
pipes. He seemed to be stuffed with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Get it well alight at the start,” he explained,
handing a fusee.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, all right, I know,” said Mathers.
Soon we were at it like four chimneys,
and Steggles praised us in such a way that
we could take no offence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ve all smoked many a time and oft,
I can see that,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Mathers spat about a good deal, and fancied
tobacco was probably a fine steadier for
the nerves before a football match; and
Nubbs said he thought so too; and he also
thought that after a little smoking one
didn’t want to talk, but ought just to keep
quiet and think of interesting things.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It widens the mind,” said Steggles.</p>

<p class='c000'>We tramped on rather silently for ten
minutes till Nubbs spoke again. To our
surprise his hopeful tone had changed, and
we found he had turned a sort of putty-color,
with blue lips. He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll overtake you fellows. I think I’ve
got--I’ve got a bit of a sunstroke or something.
It’ll pass off, no doubt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Better not smoke any more,” said Steggles.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It isn’t that, but I won’t, all the same.
I’ll just dodge through that hole in the
hedge and find some wild strawberries or
hazel-nuts, or something.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing it was a frosty day in December
Nubby’s statements looked wild. But he
went. There was a hole in the hedge, with
tree-roots trailing across it, and Nubbs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>crawled shakily through, like a wounded
rabbit, into a place where a board was stuck
up saying that people would be prosecuted
according to law if they went there. But
he didn’t seem to care, though it wasn’t a
thing he would have done in cold blood. I
saw Mathers grow uneasy in his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wasn’t the pipe--eh?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no. This tobacco--why, a child
could smoke it,” said Steggles. “You know
what Nubbs is. It’s only an excuse to turn.
He hates football and hates walking.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We kept on again, and I began to feel a
slight perspiration on my forehead and a
weird sort of feeling everywhere. I had
smoked about half the pipe.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I sha’n’t go on with this now because of
the match,” I said, hastily knocking out the
remaining tobacco and handing his loathsome
little clay back to Steggles.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why!” he said, “blessed if you haven’t
gone the same color as Nubbs did! Don’t
say you’ve got a sunstroke too?”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was something in the voice of Steggles
I didn’t much like, but I hardly felt
equal to answering him then.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“You’re all right, anyway, aren’t you,
Mathers?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course I am. What the dickens d’
you mean?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing. Glad you like my baccy.
There’s plenty of time for another pipe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No there isn’t,” said Mathers. “I very
much wish there was.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We walked on a few yards farther.</p>

<p class='c000'>“D’ you drink that rich, brown cod-liver
oil, the same as Nubby?” asked Steggles of
Mathers, suddenly. Mathers looked at him,
and I knew how things were in a moment.
For a moment my own sufferings were forgotten
before the awful spectacle of the ruin
of Mathers. He gave his pipe back quietly,
took great gasps of air, mopped his forehead,
and rolled his eyes about. Then he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m not quite happy about Nubbs. You
push on, and I’ll overtake you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hanged if you’re not queer too!” exclaimed
Steggles. “Whoever would have
thought that Three Castles--”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shut up,” said Mathers, hoarsely. “It
was the boi--boiled beef at dinner.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He spoke the words with an awful effort.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“So it was,” I said, feebly. “We never
could stand it--either of us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A steaming glass of hot grog is what
you want,” said Steggles, sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go!” gasped Mathers, who really looked
horrid now; “go! or I’ll kick you, if it kills
me to do it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Blessed if you haven’t turned green,
Mathers,” said Steggles. “You look as if
you’d been buried and dug up again. I
don’t say it unkindly, but it’s jolly curious.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same moment ting! ting! went a
bicycle bell; and there was Milly, looking
fine.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll all be late,” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>We prayed she would hurry on and not
observe us too narrowly. Then that beast,
Steggles, made her stop.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look here,” he said, “it’s frightfully
serious because of the match--these poor
chaps are ill--just cast your eye at the colors
they’ve gone. They worried me to let them
try to smoke, and--”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll break your neck for this!” interrupted
Mathers. Then he turned to M.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you’re a lady, if you ever cared an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>atom about us, please ride on round that
corner. We’re ill--can’t you see it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I can--anybody could. I’m sorry.
But you won’t hurt Steggles if I go?”
said M.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; I promise. Say we’re on the road
and shall be there in ten--ten-- Go!”</p>

<p class='c000'>M. took the hint and rode off, with Steggles
frisking beside her, like the dog he was.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank the Lord!” said Mathers. Then
horrid things happened both to him and me.</p>

<p class='c000'>We crawled to the match more dead than
alive and found a crowd waiting, and Browne
and several of the other masters. We were
fully twenty minutes late. “This is very
unsportsmanlike, the days being so short
too!” Browne squeaked. Then we took off
our coats and tottered into the field of play.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course Buckland Grammar School won.
Our side would have done a long way better
without us. I couldn’t take a pass or shoot
for the life of me--it occupied all my time
wrestling with nature, let alone the Bucklanders.
And Mathers, who played back,
was worse. The roughs “guyed” him, and
asked him what he’d been drinking. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>they’d asked him what he’d been smoking
there might have been some sense in it. He
told me afterwards that he often saw three
footballs at one time when he tried to kick,
and sometimes four, and the ball he kicked
always turned out to be an apparition. Bradwell
kept goal grandly too; but it was no
good with Mathers like that, and he utterly
ruined Ashby Major, the other back.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nubbs had gone to bed when we got back,
and the matron, knowing Nubbs had a tricky
system, sent for Doctor Barnes. Nubbs,
therefore, gave himself away.</p>

<p class='c000'>M. never looked at any of us again, and
she and Steggles undoubtedly became frightful
pals; but the next term, just before
Easter, I had the pleasure of writing a fine
letter to Mathers, who had left Merivale,
and was reading for six months with a private
tutor before going to Cambridge. This
is part of the letter:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dear Mathers,” I wrote, “you will be
interested to know that Browne has come
down on Steggles at last. I fancy Browne
knew the Doctor was fairly sick of Steggles
and wanted to be rid of him. In fact, I heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the Doctor call Steggles a canker-worm myself.
Anyway, Browne blew up on the smoking,
and Steggles will soon probably vanish,
like the dew upon the fleece. M. cried a
bit, I fancy, when she heard it, but Nubbs
says she smiled at him two mornings afterwards
coming out of chapel. Nubbs expects
to crack (his voice) any day, but he hopes
to get a definite understanding with M. before
it happens. It’ll be too late after. Of
course she never looks at me. She told
Steggles, and he told me, that she could
not possibly care for a person she had once
seen the hue of a Liberty Art Fabric--meaning
me. I scragged Steggles after he told
me. But it is all over now. I believe he is
to go into his father’s business--Steggles &amp;
Stote, Wine Merchants. M. is more beautiful
than ever, though I’m afraid she’s got a
bad disposition. To reflect on a fellow’s color
at such a time as that was a bit rough.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>The Protest of the Wing Dormitory</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>I</h3>

<p class='c008'>This is the story of the most tremendous
thing that ever happened at Dunston’s,
or any other school, I should think. Though
in it luckily, I didn’t do any of the big
part, being merely one of those chaps who
were flogged and not expelled afterwards.
Trelawny and Bradwell carried the thing
through, and all the other fellows in the
Wing Dormitory followed their lead. And,
mind you, everybody had the welfare of the
school at heart. It seemed a jolly brave
sort of thing to do, and jolly interesting.
Trelawny arranged the military side of the
business, and Bradwell, whose father is
known as the “Whiteley” of some place in
Yorkshire, looked to the commissariat, which
means feeding. As to Trelawny, who really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>captained the dormitory, he was Cornish,
and a relation of that very chap fifty thousand
Cornish men wanted to know the reason
why about long ago. He was going to be a
soldier, read history books for choice, and
already knew many military words.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was Bradwell’s fag at the time, because
Watson minor had failed in some secret
enterprise, and I remember the first conversation
which led to everything. Happening
to take some tuck in to Bradwell in the
Fifth class-room, I found Trelawny there
and heard him say:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The only way. A protest, and a jolly
dignified one, must be made. It’s for the
credit of the school, and if the Doctor will
not see it we must show him. I’ve thought
about it a lot, and I think if a section of
chaps could put themselves in a strong,
fortified position they might demand to be
heard, and even be able to offer an--an ultimatum.
Of course, doing the thing for the
good of the school and not for ourselves
makes us morally right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course,” said Bradwell.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But we must be physically strong. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>warfare the relative positions of the sides
are always taken into account when the
treaties of peace are arranged.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are you staring at?” said Bradwell
to me. “You hook it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So I hooked. But I knew perfectly well
what they were talking about. Everybody
in the Wing Dormitory did, because they
often discussed the same question after they
thought the rest of the chaps were asleep.
It was the new mathematical master,
Thompson, who troubled not only Trelawny
and Bradwell but a lot of the other fellows.
Trelawny had called him an “unholy
bounder” the third day he was there, and
that seemed to be a general opinion. Yet,
with all his bounderishness, he was awfully
clever, and meant well. But he didn’t know
anything about chaps in a general way, and
he left out his h’s and stuck them in with
awfully rum effects. Thompson tried hard
to be friendly to everybody, but only the kids
liked him. He couldn’t understand somehow,
and insulted chaps in the most frightful
way, not seeing any difference between
fellows at the top of the school and mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>kids at the bottom. Captains of elevens
were as nothing to him. He seemed to
have read up boys like he read mathematics
and stuff--from rotten books. He would
say sometimes, “Now, you fellows, let’s
’ave a jolly game of leap-frog before the bell
rings,” and things like that. Boys never
do play leap-frog except in books really.
Once he offered to show Trelawny how to
make a kite, and he asked Chambers--<em>Chambers</em>,
mind you, the Captain of the First
Eleven at Cricket--whether he knew a shop
where there were capital iron hoops for sale at
a shilling each. I heard him say it, and he put it
like this: “I say, Chambers, do you know those
splendid ’oops they sell at Burford’s in ’Igh
Street? It’s out of bounds, but if you like
I’ll get you one this evening. They’ve got
iron crooks and everything. I make this
offer because you understood a little of what
I said about Conic Sections this afternoon.”
Thompson meant so jolly well that nobody
could get in a wax with him personally; and,
as I say, the kids, who didn’t see the “unholy
bounder” side of him, and only knew
he stood gallons of ginger-beer on half-holidays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>in the playing-fields, liked him better
than anybody. But Trelawny took big
views, and so did Bradwell, and they decided
to make a definite protest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing happened till one day Thompson
said something about Trelawney’s “Celtic
thickness of skull.” That stung Trelawny
like nettles, and he set to work and arranged
the great plot of the Wing Dormitory.
He decided that the fifteen chaps
who slept in the isolated Wing Dormitory
of Dunston’s were to fortify the place, and
hold it before the world and the Doctor as
a protest against Thompson. Every chap
in the dormitory, from Trelawny and Bradwell
to Watson minor, signed their names
in their own blood on a paper Trelawny
drew out; and Watson minor fainted while
he was doing it, not being able to see his
own gore on a pen without going off. We
swore by a tremendous swear to obey Trelawny,
to fortify the Wing Dormitory
against siege, to devote every penny of
our week’s pocket-money to provisions, and
to hold out till we starved, having first
signed another paper for Doctor Dunston
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>explaining our united protest against Thompson,
and hoping for the good of the school
that he would be removed. I didn’t understand
much about it really. In fact, I don’t
believe anybody did but Trelawny and Bradwell.
Only they said we were acting for the
good of the school, and they also said that
if we held the Wing Dormitory properly nothing
short of cannon or starvation could dislodge
us. It was a tremendously tall building,
complete in itself, with iron fire-proof doors
constructed to cut it off from the rest of the
school, and with a bath-room and a lavatory
adjoining, all at a great height above the
ground. The windows were barred to keep
chaps getting out. The bars would also
keep chaps getting in, as Trelawny pointed
out. He found also that it was possible
when the iron doors were closed to pull
down some wood-work, and stick things
behind the doors so as they could not be
opened again. The only entrance to the
Wing Dormitory was through these iron
doors, so once shut we were safe against
anything but gunpowder; and Trelawny
said Doctor Dunston was not the man to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>resort to physical means, especially if it
meant knocking the place about. Bradwell
came out wonderfully about the food, and
knowing jolly well that they would turn
the water out of the bath-room when the
siege started, he made every chap fill his
basin and jug the night before; because
fresh water is vital to a siege.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were fifteen chaps, and the time
came at last, and one night we laid the
manifesto on the mat outside the iron door,
made everything fast, and waited to see
what would happen. Some fellows thought
that Thompson would be sent away at once,
to avoid the affair becoming serious; others
fancied we should be starved out or expelled
to a man. Trelawny never hazarded any
guess at what would be the end of it. “We
are doing our duty in the interests of the
school,” he said, “and whatever happens we
mean well; and if it gets into print the
sympathy of all chaps in public schools will
be on our side.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>II</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When the gas was turned out at the
meter on the night preceding the siege,
Trelawny made a short speech. First he
lighted two candles and made us sign the
protest; then he explained his military system
of night and day watches and guards.
Each of the four windows had a guard at
all hours, and two chaps were to be stationed
at the iron door. This was made
doubly strong by beds piled against it, after
the manifesto had been finally signed
and left outside. The document ran thus:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We, the undersigned, thinking that the
fame of Dunston’s is tarnished by Mr. Thompson,
M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Camb.,
hereby protest, and formally assert themselves
to call attention to Mr. Thompson.
We, the undersigned, have no personal
grudge to Mr. Thompson, but think him
unsuited to carry on the great reputation of
Dunston’s. We, the undersigned, take this
important step fully alive to the gravity of
it, for we are prepared to suffer if necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>to call attention to the subject. We do not
doubt Mr. Thompson’s goodness, and wish
it to be understood that the action is abstract
and not personal. A string will be
lowered from the third window of the Wing
Dormitory to-morrow at 8.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> Any
answer to the protest will receive instant
attention from us the undersigned.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then followed the names.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, it was all Greek to the kids,
but they put their trust in Trelawny and
signed to a kid.</p>

<p class='c000'>Inside the dormitory we were jolly busy,
too, because after Trelawny, as commander,
had made his rules and regulations clear,
Bradwell, as the head of the commissariat,
drew up a list of the total supplies, and
showed what each fellow had contributed to
the store. This list I copied for Bradwell
at the time, with notes about the different
supplies. It comes in here, and I must give
it, just to show what different ideas different
chaps have about the things you ought to
eat in a siege.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Trelawny.</span>--Two hams, eight loaves of
bread.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span><span class='sc'>Bradwell.</span>--Three tins potted salmon,
two seed-cakes (big), box of biscuits.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Ashby Major.</span>--Ten tins sardines. (Ashby
has five shillings a week pocket-money,
his father being rather rich. Bradwell said
it was rather a pity he spent it all in sardines.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Ashby Minor.</span>--Three pats of butter,
three tins Swiss milk, one tin Guava jelly.
(Bradwell was awfully pleased about the
milk, because he said it was at once nourishing
and pleasant to the taste.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Wilson.</span>--Six dried herrings, two pots
veal and ham paste, one pot marmalade.
(Herrings useless, unless eaten raw.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>West.</span>--Four bottles raspberry vinegar.
(I am West, and I thought raspberry vinegar
would be a jolly good thing to break the
monotony of a siege. But Bradwell said it
was simply a luxury.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Morrant.</span>--One hamper containing
twenty-four apples, twenty-seven pears, two
pots blackberry jam. (Morrant has no
pocket-money, but Bradwell said the fruit
was good for a change.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Gideon.</span>--Nothing. (Gideon is a Jew by
birth, and gets ten shillings a week pocket-money.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>He pretended he had forgotten.
Trelawny says he will suffer for it in the
course of the siege.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Mathers.</span>--Eight pieces of shortbread,
five slabs of toffee, seven sausage-rolls.
(The rolls were cut in half to be eaten first
thing before they went bad. But Bradwell
said Mathers had made the selection of a
fool, and so Mathers was rather vexed with
Bradwell.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Newnes.</span>--Ten loaves (five brown), one
packet of beef tabloids. (Trelawny congratulated
Newnes.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>McInnes.</span>--A lot of spring onions and
lettuces, costing one-and-sixpence. (McInnes
had been reading a book about chaps
getting scurvy on a raft, and he thought a
siege would be just the place for scurvy, so
he bought all green stuff; and Bradwell
said it was good.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Corkey Minimus.</span>--Three pounds of
mixed sweets. (Bradwell smacked his head
when he heard what Corkey minimus had
got; but Trelawny pointed out that a few
sweets served out from time to time might
distract the mind.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span><span class='sc'>Derbyshire.</span>--A pigeon-pie and thirteen
currant buns with saffron in them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Forrest.</span>--Four pots Bovril, one bottle
cider. (Bovril can be taken on bread like
treacle, and once saved the lives of several
shipwrecked sailors.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Watson Minor.</span>--Two pounds dog-biscuits,
one pound dried figs, one box of dates.
(Asked why he took dog-biscuits, he explained
it was because he had seen an advertisement
about the goodness of them. It
said they had dried buffalo meat in them,
which was a thing you could live for an immense
duration of time on. Trelawny said
that was pretty fair sense for a kid.)</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c000'>All this splendid food was brought out of
boxes where it had been hidden and placed
in the hands of Bradwell; and that night he
sat up with a candle and drew out bills of
fare and made calculations. We were rather
surprised in the morning to hear the rations
would not last more than a fortnight,
but Trelawny said the siege must be over
long before that. Nobody slept much, and
many had dressed before the first bell rang.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>When the second bell rang Trelawny and
Bradwell went to the door to listen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently Thompson, of all people, came
up and tried to get in and couldn’t. He
shook the door, then saw the envelope addressed
to the Doctor, and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s the meaning of this, you fellows?
Let me in at once!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But nobody answered. Then he cleared
off. At 8.30 the string was lowered from
the window, and Trelawny went and stood
by it to pull up any letter that might be
fastened to it. But none was. Some of
the chaps were prowling about outside looking
at the Wing Dormitory, but Trelawny
wouldn’t let anybody go to the windows except
himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, as nothing happened, we had breakfast.
McInnes and Forrest were told off
to help Bradwell, and each chap’s rations
were put on his bed after he had made it.
We all got the same except Gideon--a slice
of bread, two sardines, half one of Mathers’s
sausage-rolls, and half a tumbler of water.
So we began at once to see what a jolly
serious thing a siege is. And Gideon saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>it more than we did, because he had no
sardines and no sausage-roll. He offered
Trelawny money for a little more food, but
Trelawny said he shouldn’t have as much
as one mixed sweet, though he might pay
gold for it. He said, “You will have barely
enough to keep you alive.” And Gideon
turned awfully white when he heard it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Breakfast didn’t take more than about five
minutes, then there was a tremendous knocking
at the iron door, and Bradwell said the
trouble had begun, but Trelawny said it was
the summons to a parley. Anyway, we heard
the Doctor’s voice, and it wasn’t much of a
parley, strictly speaking, because he spoke
first, and merely gave us two minutes to be
in our places down-stairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you don’t obey, one and all of you,”
said the Doctor, “you must take the consequences.
As it is, they will be sufficiently
grave. Any further offence I shall know
how to treat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you please, sir,” said Trelawny,
“the string is out of the window. We
are doing this for the good of the school,
and--”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Then he stopped, because he had heard
the Doctor go away.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He’ll try a blacksmith first,” said Forrest;
“then, when they find they can’t do anything
with this iron door, he’ll send for policemen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But nothing was done, strangely enough,
and Trelawny made the chaps lie down and
sleep if they could in the afternoon, because
he expected a night attack with ladders.
To get in it would be necessary to remove
the bars from the windows, and anybody attempting
to do so would, of course, be at our
mercy with the windows open.</p>

<p class='c000'>For dinner that day we had one of Trelawny’s
hams cut into fifteen pieces, with
two rather thin slices of bread, one spring
onion, and three mixed sweets each, and as
much raspberry vinegar as would go into a
bullet-mold that Wilson had. Gideon ate
the ham like anybody else, which shows
Jews don’t refuse pork in any shape at times
of siege, whatever they say. Trelawny
wouldn’t give him any raspberry vinegar,
but Ashby minor let him have one of his
mixed sweets, which was green and had
arsenic in it, Ashby minor thought.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>It seemed a frightfully long day, and nothing
being done against us made it longer.
Bradwell tried to cook Wilson’s herrings
with stuff out of a pillow-case, but unfortunately
failed. Trelawny explained that
Dunston was working out tactics, and would
do something when the moon rose. He said
our motto was to be “Defence, not Defiance”;
but Derbyshire said they were going
to starve us out like rats, so as to reduce the
glory as much as possible. One or two chaps
had private rows that day, and Trelawny
was pretty short and sharp. He said we
were to regard ourselves as under martial
law, and he stopped Forrest having any tea
at all because he looked out of the window
and waved his hand to Steggles in the playground.
What made it worse for Forrest
was that we opened one of his pots of Bovril
at that very tea, and of course he didn’t have
any. But Trelawny said it was good discipline,
and wouldn’t let Mathers divide his
share with young Forrest, though he wanted
to.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day dragged out. Nothing was done,
and no letter was put on the string. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>night came and moonlight, and Trelawny
set watches at each window and door with
directions to wake him instantly if anything
happened or anybody assembled outside below.
But he didn’t sleep really. In fact,
only a few of the kids did. Bradwell got a
bit down in the mouth after dark, and I
heard him say to Trelawny it wasn’t turning
out like he thought, and Trelawny said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s always the same when a position is
impregnable. I could show you a dozen
similar sieges in history. Of course, it’s the
most uninteresting sort of siege when chaps
simply sit and see the enemy get to the end
of their food supplies, but they won’t do
that with us. The day boys will talk, and
old Dunston will raise heaven and earth to
keep it out of the printed papers. I bet he’ll
tie something to the string to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of us tried to take a bright view
like Trelawny, but when we heard him tell
Bradwell to run no risks and serve out as
little bread as possible, we felt that he did
not really feel as hopeful of a short siege
as he seemed. Just before dusk Corkey
minimus was caught in the act of flinging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>a letter out of the window addressed to his
mother. It was torn up, and he was cautioned.
That ended the day, and nothing
else happened until a quarter to one o’clock.
Then Bradwell, whose watch it was, called
“Cave!” and came to Trelawny with frightful
excitement to say that there was the
head of a ladder at his window, and a man
climbing up. Trelawny was there in a second,
and asked in a loud voice what the man
wanted, and said he’d throw the ladder down
if the man came up another rung. But the
man said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hush! you silly fellow; I’m a friend
with news from the enemy. The least you
can do is to ’ear what I’ve got to say.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good Lord!” said Trelawny, “it’s
Thompson!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And so it was, and his huge head soon
got level with the window, and looked like
a bull’s against the moonlight. Trelawny
made everybody get out of earshot except
Bradwell; but he didn’t happen to see me,
being rolled up in bed near the window, so
I heard.</p>

<p class='c000'>First Thompson said:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“Look ’ere, you Cornish boy, I’m sorry
to find we ’aven’t ’it it off by any means,
and you want me to go, and you’ve locked
yourself and friends up ’ere as a protest.
Now, ’ow ’ave I ’urt your feelings, and what
have I done?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Which was a bit difficult for Trelawny;
but he fell back on the manifesto to the
Doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s no personal matter, sir. We wish it
to be understood that the action is abstract.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh. Well, I can’t say I know what the
devil you mean by that; but I like you all
better than ever, and I understand this
much, that you don’t like me. I’m not
proud. I’m quite as ready to learn as to
teach. Tell me what makes you do this,
you queer things.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We don’t think you are the right man
for Dunston’s, sir,” said Trelawny, firmly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, but isn’t Doctor Dunston the best
judge? His experience reaches back rather
farther than yours. Anyway, I’m not going.
You’ll ’ave to tolerate me. You’ll ’ave to
like me too. I’ve disobeyed all orders by
climbing up ’ere now to advise you to give in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>to-morrow. Take my advice, and come
out at the first bell, and with ropes round
your necks. Measures are in ’and; and as
your protest has utterly failed, the sooner
you give in and take your punishment the
better. I’ve done my best to make it as
light as I can; but boys mustn’t do this sort
of thing in big schools, you know. It’s
very naughty indeed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We shall keep up the protest for another
day at least, sir,” said Trelawny, with a lot
of side in his voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, my lad, you won’t,” answered
Thompson. “The Doctor has taken my
advice, and by very simple means, with the
least possible waste of time, trouble, and
money, we shall enter your stronghold
to-morrow. I am quite good-tempered to-day.
To-morrow I shall probably be quite
cross and ’ot. The matter is in my ’ands.
Do be good boys and yield while there is
time. The sooner the better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I regret we cannot comply with your
terms, sir,” said Trelawny.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m not offering any,” answered Mr.
Thompson. “I only want to make your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>foolishness fall as light as possible. Your
mothers’ and fathers’ ’earts will ache over
this headstrong business.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The parley is ended,” said Trelawney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right,” said Mr. Thompson, “I’m
afraid you’re a hawful little prig, Trelawny.”
Then he went down the ladder, and looking
out, Bradwell reported that he saw him
taking it back to the gardener’s shed in the
shrubbery.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>III</h3>

<p class='c008'>There is not much more to be said about
the protest of the Wing Dormitory. I suppose
Thompson was better up in tactics
really than Trelawny. Anyway, he found
a weak spot that Trelawny never thought
of, and he ended the siege by half-past seven
the following morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>About six Ashby major, whose watch it
was, reported that the school fire-escape
was coming round the corner. With it appeared
Mr. Thompson, Mr. Mannering, who
is an Oxford “Blue” and not much smaller
than Mr. Thompson, the Doctor, the gardener,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>and the military agent who drills our
volunteer corps and teaches gymnastics.
They put the escape against the wall of the
Wing Dormitory, between two windows,
where it couldn’t be reached by us. Then
Thompson and Mannering went up, and the
sergeant and gardener followed. The Doctor
waited at the foot of the ladder.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They’ll get through the roof!” said
Trelawny; “I never thought of that!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Trelawny turned awfully rum in the face,
and tried to think out a way of repelling
a roof attack; but there wasn’t time. In
about ten minutes or so the end of an iron
bar came through the ceiling; then followed
a regular avalanche of plaster and dust, that
fell on Watson minor and jolly nearly smothered
him. Then came Thompson, Mannering
followed, and the gardener and the
sergeant dropped after them as quick as
lightning. Of course, we were done, because
only half of us were fighters, the rest
being kids; and Trelawny himself being just
fifteen and Bradwell fourteen and Ashby
major twelve and a half, and I only eleven
and a half, it was no good.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“We surrender,” said Trelawny.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Surrender, you little brute, I should
think you did yield!” said Mannering, who
had cut his hand getting the slates off the
roof, and was in a rare bate.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You needn’t insult a defeated force, sir,”
said Trelawny, keeping his nerve jolly well.
“We are prepared to pay the penalty of
failure, and having meant well we--we don’t
care.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But whether we meant well or not, I know
Trelawney and Bradwell both got expelled,
though Thompson was said to have tried
very hard for them. Dunston didn’t seem
to realize what frightfully good motives
prompted them to protest against Thompson
in an abstract way. Nothing was done to
anybody else except Ashby major and me
and Wilson. We were flogged by Mr. Mannering
for the Doctor; and he did it as you
might expect from a “Blue.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As for Thompson, he stayed on, and the
protest never got into print; and there wasn’t
much disgrace for Trelawny or Bradwell
after all, because the first afterwards got into
Woolwich ten from the top, through an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>army crammer’s, and the second joined his
father, who was the Whiteley of the North
I spoke of. He wrote to me only a week
ago to say that he was getting a hundred
pounds a year from his governor for doing
much less than he had to do at Dunston’s.
Mind you, Thompson is a jolly good sort,
really, and we know it now; and, as I heard
my uncle say of somebody else, I don’t suppose
it’s a matter of life and death whether
or no a chap puts his h’s in the wrong places
if his heart’s in the right one.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>“Freckles” and “Frenchy”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He was the most peculiar chap that
ever came to Merivale, not excepting
even Mason, who shot the Doctor’s wife’s
parrot with a catapult, and, after he had been
flogged, offered to stuff it in the face of
the whole school, and nearly got expelled.
Freckles was so called owing to his skin,
which was simply a complicated pattern
much like what you can see in any map of
the Grecian Archipelago. This arose, he
thought, from his having been born in Australia.
Anyway, it was rum to see; and so
were his hands, which had reddish down on
the backs. His eyes were, also reddish--a
sort of mixture of red and gray specks, and
they glimmered like a cat’s when he was
angry, which was often. His real name was
Maine, and he had no side. His father
had made a big fortune selling wool at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Sydney, and his grandfather was one of the
last people to be transported to Botany Bay
through no fault of his own. After he had
been on a convict ship five years a chap
at home confessed on his death-bed that he
had done the thing Maine’s grandfather
was transported for. So they naturally let
Maine’s grandfather go free; and he was so
much annoyed about it that he never came
back home again, but married a farmer’s
daughter near Sydney and settled out there
for good.</p>

<p class='c000'>Maine didn’t think great things of England,
and was always talking about the Australian
forests of blue gum-trees and bush, and
sneering rather at the size of our forests
round Merivale, though they were good ones.
He never joined in games, but roamed away
alone for miles and miles into the country on
half-holidays, and trespassed with a cheek I
never saw equalled. He could run like a
hare--especially about half a mile or so,
which, as he explained to me, is just about
a distance to blow a keeper. Certainly,
though often chased, he was never caught
and never recognized, owing to things he did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>which he had learned in Australia and copied
from famous bushrangers. His great hope
some day was to be a bushranger himself,
and he practised in a quiet way every Saturday
afternoon, making it a rule to go out of
bounds always. His get-up was fine. My
name is Tomkins, called “Nubby” because
I happen to have a rather large sort of nose,
and, being fond of the country and not keen
on games, Maine rather took to me, and after
I had sworn on crossed knives not to say a
word to a soul (which I never did till Freckles
left) he told me his secrets and showed
me his things. If you’d seen Freckles starting
for an excursion you wouldn’t have said
there was anything remarkable about him;
but really he was armed to the teeth, and
had everything a bushranger would be likely
to want in a quiet place like Merivale. Down
his leg was the barrel of an air-gun, strong
enough to kill any small thing like a cat at
twenty-five yards; the rest of the gun was
arranged inside the lining of his coat, and
the slugs it fired he carried loose in his
trousers-pockets. Round his waist he had a
leather belt he got from a sailor for a pound.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Inside the leather was human skin, said to
be flayed off a chap by cannibals somewhere,
which was a splendid thing to have for your
own, if it was true; and in the belt a place
had been specially made for a knife. Freckles,
of course, had a knife in it--a “bowie”
knife that made you cold to see. He never
used it, but kept it ready, and said if a
keeper ever caught him he possibly might
have to. In addition to these things he
carried in his coat-pockets a little spirit-lamp
and a collapsible tin pot and a bag
of tea.</p>

<p class='c000'>He said tea was the very life of men in the
bush, and that often after a hard escape,
when he was out of danger, he would get
away behind a woodstack or under banks
of a stream, or some such secret place, and
brew a cup and drink it, and feel the better
for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly, Freckles had a flat lead mask with
holes for the eyes and mouth, which he
always fitted on when trespassing. He said
it was copied from the helmet Ned Kelly,
the King of the Bushrangers, used to wear,
but it was not bullet-proof, but only used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>for a disguise. We were in the same dormitory,
and one night, when all the chaps had
gone to sleep, he dressed up in these things
and stood where some moonlight came in,
and certainly looked jolly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once, as an awful favor--me being smaller
than him, and not fast enough to run away
from a man--he let me come and see what
he did when bushranging on a half-holiday
in winter. “I sha’n’t run my usual frightful
risks with you,” he said, “because I
might have to open fire to save you, and that
would be very disagreeable to me; but we’ll
trespass a bit, and I’ll shoot a few things,
if I can. I don’t shoot much, only for
food.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He made me a mask with tinfoil off chocolate
smoothed out and gummed on cardboard;
but I had no weapons, and he said I
had better not try and get any.</p>

<p class='c000'>We started for the usual walk. Chaps
were allowed to go through a public pine-wood
to Merivale; but half through, by a
place where was a board which warned us to
keep the path, Freckles branched off into
some dead bracken, and squatted down and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>put on his mask. I also put on mine. Then
he fastened his air-gun together and loaded
it, and told me to walk six paces behind him
and do as he did. His eyes were awfully
keen, and now and then he pointed to a
feather on the ground, or an old nest or a
patch of rum fungus or a crab-apple still
hanging on the tree, though all the leaves
were off.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once he fired at a jay and missed it, then
fell down in the fern as if he was shot himself,
and remained quite motionless for some
time. He told me that he always did so
after firing, that he might hear if anybody
had been attracted by the sound. It was a
well-known bushman’s dodge. Once we saw
a keeper through a clearing, and Freckles
lay flat on his stomach, and so did I. He
knew the keeper well, and told me that he
had many times escaped from him. We
waited half an hour, and turned to go back
a different way from that of the keeper.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, where a glade sloped down to some
water and the grass was all dewy and covered
with mole-hills, Freckles went to inspect
a trap he had set a week before. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>was collecting skins for a mole-skin waistcoat,
but he said skinning moles was one of
the beastliest tasks a hunter ever had.
However, there was a mole caught, and he
skinned it and wrapped up the skin in
leaves and put it in his hat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then we had some real sport, for on the
other side of the glade we saw rabbits lopping
about, and Freckles stalked them
through the fern while I waited motionless,
and finally he shot a young one. I wanted
to take it back and get cook to do it for us,
but he said I was a fool.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you want any you must have it now.
It’s about the time I take a meal,” he said,
“and that’s a part of my ranging and hunting
you haven’t seen yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew the country well, and said we
were in one of the most carefully preserved
places anywhere about, which must have
been true, for there were an awful lot of
pheasants calling in the glades. But Freckles
got down into a drain and showed me a
hollow he had scooped out under a lot of
ivy where it fell over a bank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is one of my caves,” he said, “and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>here we can feed and drink in safety; but
you mustn’t talk or I sha’n’t be able to hear
if anything is stirring in the woods.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He took off his mask, set down his gun,
and lighted his spirit-stove.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Skin the rabbit and cut off his hind-legs
while I make tea,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>So I did, and he held them over the lamp
till they were slightly cooked outside, but
not right through. He ate and drank with
his ears straining for every sound. Then he
took the rest of the rabbit and removed
all traces of eating, and buried everything
we had left.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I didn’t,” he explained, “some keeper’s
dog would find my lair, and make a row
and give it away, and the keepers would
doubtless lie in wait for me and catch me
red-handed. You can’t be too careful,
because every man’s hand’s against you;
which, of course, is the beauty of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We got back without anything happening,
and I’ve hated the sight of rabbit pretty
well ever since, but Freckles said the juices
of animals are better for the human frame
underdone.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Well, that gives you an idea of Freckles,
and the affair with Frenchy, which I am
going to tell you about, showed that he really
was cut out for bushranging. Frenchy, as
we called him, was Monsieur Michel. He
didn’t belong entirely to Dunston’s, but
lived in Merivale and came to us three days
a week, and went to a girl’s school the other
three. He was a rum, oldish chap, whose
great peculiarities were to make puns in
English and to appeal to our honor about
everything.</p>

<p class='c000'>He would slang a fellow horribly one day,
and wave his arms and pretty nearly jump
out of his skin; and the next day he would
bring up a whacking pear for the fellow
he’d slanged, or a new knife or something.
He pretty nearly cried sometimes, and he
told us his nerves were frightfully tricky,
and often led him to be harsh when he
didn’t mean it. He couldn’t keep order
or make chaps work if they didn’t choose;
and Steggles, who had an awfully cunning
dodge of always rubbing him up the wrong
way, and then looking crushed and broken-hearted
so as to get things, which he did,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>said that Frenchy was like damp fireworks,
because you never knew exactly when he’d
go off or how.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day, dashing out of class with a
frightful yell, Freckles got sent for, and
went back and found Monsieur raving mad.
It seemed that Freckles had yelled too soon--before
he was out of the class-room, in
fact, and Frenchy had got palpitation of the
heart from it. He let into Freckles properly
then. He said he was his “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>bête noire</em></span>” and
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>un sot à vingt-quatre carats</em></span>”--which means
an eighteen-carat ass in English, but twenty-four
carats in French--and “one of the
aborigines who ought to be kept on a chain,”
and many other such-like things. Freckles
turned all colors, and then white, with a
sort of bluish tint to his lips. He didn’t say
a word, but looked at Frenchy with such a
frightful expression that I felt something
would happen later. All that happened at
the time was that Freckles got the eighth
book of Telemachus to write out into French
from English, and then correct by Fénelon,
which was a pretty big job if a chap had
been fool enough to try and do it; and Monsieur
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Michel went off to Merivale with a
big card on his coat-tail with “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Ici on parle
Français</em></span>” written upon it in red pencil.
This I had managed to do myself while
Frenchy was jawing Freckles. I told
Freckles, but it didn’t comfort him much.
He said there were some things no mortal
chap could stand; and to be called “an aborigine”
because a man was born in Australia
seemed to him about the bitterest insult even
an old frog-eating Frenchman could have
invented. Happening to <em>him</em>, of all chaps,
it was especially a thing which would have
to be revenged, seeing what his views were.
He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I couldn’t bushrange or anything with
a clear conscience in the future if I had a
thing like this hanging over me unrevenged.
It’s the frightfulest slur on my character,
and I won’t sit down under it for fifty
Frenchmen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he said he should take a week to
settle what to do, and went into the playground
alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next time Frenchy came up he was just
the same as ever--awfully easy-going and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>jolly, and let Freckles off the Telemachus,
and offered him as classy a knife, with a
corkscrew and other things, including
tweezers, as ever you saw--just the knife
for Freckles, considering his ways. But it
didn’t come off. Freckles got white again
when he saw the knife, and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you, Monsieur, I don’t want your
knife; and the imposition is half done, and
will be finished next time you come.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frenchy called him a silly boy, and
tried to make a joke and pinch Freckles by
the ear. But nobody saw the joke, and
Freckles dodged away. Then Frenchy
sighed, and looked round to see who should
have the knife, and didn’t seem to see anybody
in particular, and left it on his desk.
He often sighed in class, and sometimes
told us he was without friends, unless he
might call us friends; and we said he
might.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he went, Freckles told me he considered
the knife was another insult. Then
he explained what he was going to do. He
said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall finish the impot first, so as not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>be obliged to him for anything, and then I
shall stick him up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stick him up--how?” I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a bushranging expression,” he explained.
“To ‘stick up’ a man is to make
him stand and deliver what he’s got. I see
my way to do this with Frenchy. He always
goes and comes from Merivale through the
woods, as you know, and now he’s up here on
Friday nights coaching Slade and Betterton
for their army exam. Afterwards he has supper
with Mr. Thompson or the Doctor. There
you are. I wait my time in the wood, which
is jolly lonely by night, though it is such a
potty little place hardly worth calling a wood;
then he comes along, and I stick him up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s highway robbery,” I said. “You
might get years and years of imprisonment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I might,” he said, “but I sha’n’t. You
must begin your career some time, and I’m
going to next Friday night. I’ve often got
out of the dormitory and been in that wood
by night, and only the chaps in the dormitory
have known it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, the night came, and all that we
heard about it till afterwards was that about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>eleven o’clock, or possibly even later than
that, there was a fearful pealing at the front
door of Dunston’s, and looking out we could
see a stretcher and something on it. That
something was actually Freckles, though
the few chaps who knew what was going to
be done felt sure it must be Frenchy; because
Freckles is five feet ten and growing,
and Frenchy isn’t more than five feet six at
the outside, and a poor thing at that.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it <em>was</em> Freckles all right, and two
laboring men had brought him back, and
Frenchy had come with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not until five weeks afterwards, when
Freckles could get up and limp about, did I
hear the truth; and I’ll tell it in his own
words, because they must be better than a
chap’s who wasn’t there. He seemed frightfully
down in the mouth, and said that he
could never look fellows in the eyes again;
but it cheered him telling me, and when I
told him he was thundering well out of it he
admitted he was. He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>"I got off all right, and the moon was as
clear as day, and everything just ripe for
sticking a chap up. Then, like a fool, having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>a longish time to wait, I didn’t simply
stop in shadow behind a tree-trunk or something
in the usual way, but thought I’d do a
thing I’d never heard of bushrangers doing,
though Indian thugs are pretty good at it.
I went and got up a tree which has a branch
over the road, and I thought I’d drop down
almost on top of Frenchy to start with.
And that’s just what I did do, only I dropped
wrong, and came down pretty nearly on my
head owing to slipping somehow at the start.
What did exactly happen to me as I left the
tree I never shall know. Anyway, Frenchy
came along sure enough, and I dropped, and
he jumped I should think fully a yard in the
air; but that was all, because in falling I hit
a big root (it was a beech-tree), and went and
broke something in my ankle and something
in my chest and couldn’t stand. Consequently,
of course, I couldn’t stick him up. The
pain was pretty fair, but feeling what a fool
I was seemed to make me forget it. Anyway,
finding it was useless to think of sticking
him up, I tried to hobble into the fern and
get out of sight; and finding I couldn’t
crawl, I rolled. But of course you can’t roll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>away from a chap, and he came after me,
and my mask fell off while I rolled, and he
recognized me.</p>

<p class='c000'>"‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Mon Dieu!</em></span> it is the boy Maine!’ he
said. ‘Speak, child, what in the wide world
was this?’</p>

<p class='c000'>"I disguised my voice and said I wasn’t
Maine, and that he’d better leave me alone
or it might be the worse for him yet. But
he wouldn’t go, and, chancing to get queer
about the head somehow I went off, I suppose,
though it wasn’t for long. When I
came to he was gone, but he rushed back in
a minute with that rotten old top-hat he
wears full of water he’d got from the puddle
in the stone-pit. He doused my head and
made me sit up with my back against a tree.
Then, feeling the frightfulness of it, I begged
him to clear out and let me alone. I said:</p>

<p class='c000'>"‘You don’t know what you’re doing.
I’m no friend to you, but the deadliest
enemy you’ve got in the world, and if I
hadn’t fallen down at a critical moment and
broken myself I should have stuck you up,
Monsieur Michel. So, now, you know.’</p>

<p class='c000'>"He said to himself, ‘The poor mad boy--the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>poor mad boy--I will run <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>à toutes
jambes</em></span> for succor’; but I told him not to. I
began to get a rum hot pain in my side then,
but I felt I would gladly have died there
rather than be obliged to him. I said:</p>

<p class='c000'>"‘You called me an “aborigine,” which
is the most terrible thing you can call an
Australian-born chap, and you wanted to
pass it off with a knife with a corkscrew
and tweezers in it. But you couldn’t expect
me to take it, feeling as I did. Now the
fortunes of war have given you the victory,
and, if you please, I wish you’d go.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“But he refused. He said he wouldn’t
have hurt my feelings for anything. He
seemed to overlook altogether what I was
going to do to him, and asked me where it
hurt me. I told him, and he said it was his
fault--fancy that! and wished he was big
enough to carry me back. I kept on asking
him to go, and at last, after begging my
pardon like anything, for about a week it
seemed, he went. But I heard him shouting
and yelling French yells in the woods, and
after a bit he came back with two men and
a hurdle. They presently took me back,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>and what Frenchy’s said since to the Doctor
I don’t know. In fact, I didn’t know anything
for days. Anyway, I’ve had nothing
but a mild rowing and very good grub, and
I’m not to be even flogged, though that’s
probably because I broke a rib or two, not
including the bone in my leg. But I’m all
right now, and I think it was about the most
sporting thing a chap ever did for Frenchy
to treat me like that--eh? I shouldn’t have
thought it was in a Frenchman to do it, especially
after I told him what I was going
to do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” I said, “that’s all right, but what
about bushranging?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s pretty sickening,” he said, “but I
feel as if all the keenness was knocked out
of me. If a chap can’t so much as fall out
of a tree on a wanderer’s path at the nick of
time without smashing himself, what’s the
good of him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Besides,” I said, “if it hadn’t been
Frenchy, but somebody else of a different
turn of mind, he might have taken you at a
disadvantage and jolly well killed you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In real bushranging that is what would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>have happened,” admitted Freckles. “As it
is, I expect months, perhaps years, will have
to go by before I feel to hanker after it again.
And meantime I sha’n’t rest in peace till I’ve
paid Frenchy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I believe it’s to be done. He’s
often come to see me while I was on my
back in bed, and he’s told me a lot about
himself. He’s frightfully hard up, and a
Roman Catholic, and hopes to lay his
bones in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>la belle</em></span> France with luck, but he
doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to manage
it. He told me all this, little knowing my
father was extremely rich. Well, you see,
the mater wants somebody French for the
kids at home, which are girls, and, knowing
Frenchy bars this climate, I think Australia
might do him good. He’s fifty-three years
old, and it seems to me if the guv’nor wrote
and offered him his passage and a good
screw he’d go. I have made it a personal
thing to myself, and told the guv’nor what
a good little chap he is, and what a beautiful
accent he’s got, and the thing that happened
in the wood.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>The affair dropped then, and about six
weeks after, when Freckles was getting fit
again, he walked with me one half-holiday
to see the place where he was smashed up.
The bough was a frightful high one to drop
from even in daylight, also it was broken.
Freckles got awfully excited when he spotted
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There! there!” he said, “that’s the
best thing I’ve seen for twelve weeks!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t see much to squeak about,” I
said, “especially as the beastly tree nearly
did for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But can’t you see it’s broken? That’s
what did it! I thought I slipped, and if I
had I shouldn’t have been made of the stuff
for a bushranger; but the wretched branch
broke, and that is jolly different. That
wasn’t my fault. The most hardened old
hand must have come down then. In fact,
he couldn’t have stopped up. Oh, what a
lot of misery I’d have been saved through
all these weeks if I’d known it broke in a
natural sort of way!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He got an awful deal of comfort out of
this, and said he should return to his old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>ways again as soon as he could run a mile
without stopping. And we found his lead
mask, like Ned Kelly’s, just where it had
dropped when he had rolled over in the fern,
and he welcomed it like a dog.</p>

<p class='c000'>That’s the end, except that his father
did write to Dunston about Frenchy; and
Dunston, not being very keen about Frenchy
himself, seemed to think he would be just
the chap for the girls of Freckles’s father.
Anyway, he went, and he cried when he
said good-bye to the school; and Freckles
told me that when he said good-bye to
him he yelled with crying, and blessed him
both in French and English, and said that
the sunny atmosphere of Australia would
very likely prolong his life until he had
saved enough to get his bones back to France.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he went, and Freckles went after him
much sooner than he ever expected to, because
the keepers finally caught him in the
game preserves, sitting in his hole under
the stream bank, frizzling the leg of a pheasant
which he had shot out of a tree with his
air-gun and buried seven days before. And
Dunston wrote to his father, and his father
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>wrote back that Freckles, being now fourteen
and apparently having less sense than
when he left Australia, had better return to
his native land, and go into the wool business,
and begin life as an office-boy in his
place of business. Freckles told me that
chaps in his father’s office generally got a
fortnight’s holiday, but that his mother
would probably work up his governor to give
him three weeks. Then he would get a
proper outfit and track away to the boundless
scrub, and fall in with other chaps who
had similar ideas, and begin to take life
seriously. He said I might see his name in
Australian papers in about a year. But he
never wrote to me, and I don’t know if he
really succeeded well. I’m sure I hope he
did, for he was a tidy chap, though queer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>Concerning Corkey Minimus</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'>I</h3>

<p class='c008'>If Corkey minor had been at school that
term the thing would never have come
about; but Corkey minor was always one of
the lucky chaps, and just when, in the ordinary
course of events, he would have had
to begin fagging for an exam., something
happened to his right lung, and he had to
go on an awful fine trip to Australia in a
sailing ship. That left Corkey major, who
was a mere learning machine in the Sixth,
and Corkey minimus, who was ten, and in
the Lower Fourth.</p>

<p class='c000'>It began like this. After Bray had licked
Derbyshire and Bethune, which he did one
after the other on the same half-holiday,
chaps gave him “best,” as a matter of
course, and he became cock of the lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>school. He was solid muscle all through,
and harder than stone, and he had a brother
in London who was runner-up in the amateur
“light-weight” championship two years
following. Bray fancied himself a bit, naturally,
and was always roaming about seeking
fellows to punch. But once, out of
bounds in a private wood, a keeper caught
him and licked him, which was seen by two
other fellows, and remembered against Bray
afterwards when he put on too much side.</p>

<p class='c000'>He and Corkey minimus were in the same
class, because Bray, though thirteen, didn’t
know much. At first they were great chums,
and Bray bossed Corkey and palled with
him; and when Browne, the under mathematical
master, told Corkey minimus that
he was “the least of all the Corkeys, and
not worthy to be called a Corkey,” because
he couldn’t do rule-of-three, or some rot,
Bray said a thing that Browne overheard,
and got sent up. But by degrees the friendship
of Bray and Corkey minimus cooled off,
and the matter of Milly settled it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Doctor had four daughters, and Milly
was the youngest. Mabel and Ethel held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>no dealings with any fellows under the Sixth,
and Mary had something wrong with her
spine and didn’t count. But I never cared
for any of them myself, because you couldn’t
tell what they meant. Beatrice, for instance,
was absolutely engaged to Morris, for he
told his sister so in the holidays, and his
sister told Morris minor, and he told me the
next term. Morris was the head of the
school, and he had her photograph fixed
into a foreign nut which he wore on his
watch-chain. But when he left, and she
found out he was gone into a bank at £80
a year, she dropped him like a spider. Mind
you, Morris had told her he was descended,
on his mother’s side, from a race of old Irish
kings, which may have unsettled her. Anyway,
when she found he came, on his father’s
side, from a race of church curates,
she wrote and said it was off.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there were other things that upset the
chumming of Bray and Corkey minimus
before the Milly row, and they ought to
be taken in turn. First, there was the Old
Testament prize, which was the only thing
Bray had the ghost of a chance of getting.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>But Corkey beat him by twenty-three
marks; and Bray said afterwards that Corkey
had cribbed a lot of stuff about Joshua,
and Corkey said he hadn’t, and even declared
he knew as much about Joshua as Bray, and a
bit over. Then, on top of that, came the match
with neckties, which was rather a rum match
in its way. Both of them used to be awfully
swagger about their neckties, and each
fancied his own. So one bet the other half
a crown he would wear a different necktie
every day for a month. The month being
June, that meant thirty different neckties
each, and the chap who wore the best neckties
would win. A fellow called Fowle was
judge, being the son of an artist; and neither
Bray nor Corkey was allowed to buy a
single new tie or add to the stock he had in
his box. At the end of a fortnight they
stood about equal, though Corkey’s ties
were rather more artistic than Bray’s, which
were chiefly yellow and spotted. But then
came an awful falling away, and some of the
affairs they wore were simply weird. The
test for these was if the tie passed in class.
Then the terms of the match were altered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>and they decided to go on wearing different
things till one or other was stopped by a
master. Any concern not noticed was considered
a necktie “in the ordinary acceptation
of that term,” as Fowle put it. At the
end of the third week Corkey minimus came
out in an umbrella cover done in a sailor’s
knot, but nobody worth mentioning spotted
it; and the next day Bray wore a bit of blue
ribbon off a chocolate box, which also
passed. They struggled on this sort of
way till Bray got bowled over. I think
Corkey was wearing a yard-measure dipped
in red ink that morning, but it looked rather
swagger than not. Class was just ended,
when old Briggs, of all people--a man who
wore two pairs of spectacles at one time
very often--said to Bray:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is that round your neck, boy?”
And Bray said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“My tie, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Briggs said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it, sir? Let me see it, please. I
have noticed an increasing disorder about
your neck arrangements for a week past.
You insult me and you insult the class
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>by appearing here in these ridiculous
ties.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It sha’n’t happen again, sir,” said Bray,
trying to edge out of the class-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, Bray, it shall not,” said old Briggs.
“Bring me that thing at once, please.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Bray handed it up, and Briggs examined
it as if it was a botanical specimen or something.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This,” he announced, “is not a necktie
at all. You’re wearing a piece of Brussels
carpet, wretched boy--a fragment of the
new carpet laid down yesterday in the Doctor’s
study. You will kindly take it to him
immediately, say who sent you, and state
the purpose to which you were putting it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So Bray, by the terms of the match, lost,
and Corkey minimus won with the yard
measure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the feeling between them grew, especially
after Bray said that he could only
pay his half-crown in instalments of a penny
a week.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now we come to Milly. You see she was
Corkey minor’s great pal the term before,
but now that he was at sea, and thousands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>of miles off, she chucked him and turned to
Corkey minimus. That shows what she
was really. Anyway, in a bad moment for
young Corkey, she told him he had eyes
like an eagle’s, and it simply turned his
head. As an eagle’s eyes are yellow, I
couldn’t see myself what there was to be so
jolly pleased about; but he was, and, to
show you what a chap may come to if a girl
collars him, I know for a fact that Corkey
minimus tried to paint a picture for her.
Whether he actually succeeded I cannot say,
but he went down four places in class, and
got awfully dropped on by Browne.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then came that attempt of Bray to cut
Corkey out, and, being myself a tremendous
personal chum of Corkey’s, I wished he had
succeeded; but he didn’t, and even his
fighting didn’t take Milly. After a month
of giving her things to eat and so on, he
said it was his red hair that stood between
them, and told Fowle he didn’t care a straw
about her; but from the way he went on
to Corkey minimus, any fool could see he
really cared a lot. The chap called Fowle
comes in here. This “obscene Fowle,” as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>we called him out of Virgil, being really a
term in a crib applied to harpies, though he
would have run if a mouse had squeaked at
him, was yet responsible for more fights
than any fellow in the school. He sneaked
about, asking chaps if they gave one another
“best,” and when at last he found
two who didn’t funk each other, though
they might be perfectly good friends, he
never rested until there was a fight. He
got kicked sometimes, but not enough.
That was owing to the fact that his hampers
from home were most extraordinary.
They came on Roman feast days, because
he was a Roman Catholic by religion; and
some fellows even said the more you kicked
Fowle the more you were likely to get
from the hampers. That was rot, of course,
and a jolly suspicious thing happened once.
Newnes--a chap in the lower Fifth--kicked
Fowle the very morning before a hamper
came; and that same evening, after prayers,
Fowle gave Newnes about half a whacking
big melon, and the next day Newnes jolly
near died. Fowle swore he hadn’t put anything
in the melon, but it is bosh to say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>that half a melon, if it’s all right, is going
to do a chap any harm. Anyway, we rather
funked Fowle’s hampers afterwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, this wretched, obscene Fowle met
me one day licking his fat lips and showing
great excitement. So I knew he’d probably
worked up a fight; but it wasn’t that, though
something worse. He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where’s Corkey minimus? Bray wants
him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What for?” I said. I may mention that
I am called McInnes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As a matter of fact, he’s heard something,
and he says, though he’s sorry, he’s got to
lick Corkey.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Fowle smacked his beastly mouth as if
he’d got pine-apple drops in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s Corkey done?” I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s about Milly Dunston. Young Corkey
talks jolly big with her, and doesn’t even
speak civil of his friends. By quite an accident
I was passing through the shrubbery
from Browne’s house to the chapel yesterday,
and I went by the summer-house, which
is out of bounds, and couldn’t help overhearing
Milly and Corkey minimus, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>were there. And Corkey distinctly said
that Bray was as fiery as his hair, and that
he had no more control of himself than a
burning mountain; and Milly laughed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you sneaked off and told Bray?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“As his chum I had to.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, then I shall tell Corkey what you
heard, being his chum.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shouldn’t,” said Fowle. “It’s only
making mischief. Besides, Bray won’t take
an apology now. He says he’s stood all that
flesh and blood can stand. Those were his
very words. In fact, I’m looking for Corkey
minimus at this moment to tell him that
Bray wants him up in the ‘gym.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To lick him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Fowle smacked his lips again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He’s brought it on himself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” I said, “I’ll give the message.
You can go back and tell Bray you’ve told
me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’d rather have done it myself,” said
Fowle, regretfully, as though he was being
robbed of tuck.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, you won’t,” I answered him, being
pretty sick with the worm of a chap by that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>time. “You go back and say that Corkey
will turn up in ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he cleared out reluctantly, leaving
this tremendous responsibility entirely on
my hands.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>II</h3>

<p class='c008'>I went off there and then for Corkey.
It’s a bit of a jar for a chap to get a message
like that unexpectedly, and I didn’t
know what advice to give. Corkey major
was no good. If I’d told him he would
have blinked through his goggles and have
said some bosh--very likely in Latin. And
Corkey minor, being thousands of miles
away, it looked blue, because you can’t ask
anybody but a chap’s own brothers to take
up a matter like this. I couldn’t lick Bray
myself, or I would have.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next minute I met Corkey himself,
and, from an awful rum look about him, I
thought for a moment he’d had the licking
already. But he hadn’t, and before I could
speak he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“McInnes, I’ve got to fight Bray.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“My dear chap, you couldn’t,” I began.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know,” he answered, “but I’ve got to.
Things have happened. Listen to this. I’ve
just left Milly, and she’s in a frightful bate.
I shouldn’t have thought a girl could have
got in such a rage without hurting herself.
Bray told Fowle that there were as good fish
in the sea as ever came out of it--meaning
Milly; and Fowle wrote it on a bit of paper
and dropped it where Milly was bound to see
it. He didn’t put his name, but she knows
his writing. Now she’s pretty well mad,
and says it’s a disgrace that a thick-necked,
speckly, stumpy chap like Bray should be
cock of the lower school. Well, I said, very
likely it was, but I didn’t see how it could
be helped, him being such a fighter. Then
she tossed her hair about, and said, ‘I won’t
have anything more to do with the lower
school at all while he’s cock of it.’ Of course,
I didn’t think she included me, being--well,
her greatest pal alive since Corkey minor
went. So I said, ‘Quite right; I shouldn’t
look at them.’ Then she turned round
rather suddenly and said <em>I</em> was included.
So I said, ‘I should be only too glad to fight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>him if there was a ghost of a chance, but
there isn’t. It’s no good pretending. He’s
four inches taller, and miles more round the
chest and round the arms, and ages older.
In fact, he could lick me with one hand tied
behind him.’ Then she said, ‘The days of
chivalry are dead,’ which she’d got out of a
book, of course; and she added that she was
tired of all boys, and that a chap with eyes
like mine ought to have more ‘devil’ in him.
Yes, she used that word. I said, ‘What do
you want me to do?’ And she said, ‘Oh,
nothing. I wouldn’t have a hair of your
head singed for the world; only I thought
that it might interest you more than other
people to know I’d been insulted. Of course,
if it’s nothing to you--’ Then she stopped
and marched away, and I went after her and
asked her to explain, and she answered that
the explanation ought to come from me.
She said, ‘D’ you ever read dragon stories?’
And I said, ‘Yes.’ Then she went on, ‘Well,
in all the ones I’ve read, if a lady asked anybody
to kill a dragon, the person didn’t say
that the dragon could beat him with one
paw tied behind it, even though he thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>so; but he jolly well went and did the best
he could.’ Naturally, after that I saw what
she meant, and I said, ‘Oh, all right, Milly;
of course, if you’ve been insulted, I must
make the beggar apologize--or try to.’ ‘Yes,’
she said, cheering up like anything; ‘you
are my own precious champion, and I love
you.’ I tell you all this because you’re my
chum, and you’ll have to be my second. And
if I can even black his eye before he settles
me, it will be something.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I call it a chouse,” I said. “She
might as well have asked you to fight Blanchard
or Sims. Look at your arms, not to
mention anything else; they’re like cabbage-stalks.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I know all that,” said Corkey minimus,
“and it’ll be rather rotten for her if
he kills me. But the thing’s got to be done,
and the sooner it’s over the better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then I suddenly remembered Bray’s message,
and told Corkey. He seemed surprised.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He can’t lick me on the spot if I challenge
him to fight in a regular way, can
he?” he asked, but rather doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>I said it seemed to me he couldn’t. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>we went up to the “gym,” where Bray was
talking to about four chaps, including
Fowle.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, you’ve come, you kid, have you?
You’d better not keep me waiting another
time when I send for you,” he began. “Now
I’m going to lick you for cheek.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What cheek?” Corkey minimus said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fowle heard you say I was as fiery as
my hair.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Fowle, he hears a lot, I know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you say it or didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I did, and I say it again; and
you’re a dirty bully too.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Bray came quite close to Corkey minimus,
and put his face so near that their noses were
almost touching, like cats do when they’re
going to have a row on a wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Say that just once more if it isn’t troubling
you too much,” said Bray.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll say it as often as you like,” answered
young Corkey, keeping his eye on Bray’s,
“and I’ll say another thing too, which is,
that before you talk so big about me being
a ‘kid’ and licking me, you’d better find out
first if I give you ‘best.’”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“Golly!” said Bray, grinning like mad,
“don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, I don’t; and I’ll fight you properly
with seconds the first minute we
can.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Corkey minimus had certainly come out
of it fine so far, and I only wished he could
fight as well as he talked. Of course, from
Bray’s point of view, it was the best thing
that could have happened, because now he
had a right to lick Corkey, and a right to
lick him as badly as he could. The bell
rang a minute afterwards, and going in it
was settled the fight should come off next
Wednesday, that being a half-holiday. Part
of Merivale Woods skirted the cricket-field,
and as the second eleven, to which Bray belonged,
wasn’t playing a match, everything
suited very comfortably. Blanchard, the
cock of the school, agreed to umpire, and he
and another chap in the Fifth very kindly
promised to carry young Corkey home by a
secluded way if he was too much smashed
to walk. Fowle seconded Bray, and I saw
Bray teaching him how to fan with a towel
and spurt water over a fellow’s face between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>the rounds. Of course, it was about as
good fun as killing rats with a stick for
Bray.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>III</h3>

<p class='c008'>Corkey minimus saw Milly once or twice
before the fight, and he said he couldn’t
make out whether she was going mad or
what. One minute she wanted him to fight,
the next she implored him not to; one
minute she hoped he would mutilate Bray
to pieces, the next she blubbed and prayed
him if ever he had any liking for her to give
Bray “best.” She said she kept dreaming
of him brought back stark and stiff; and
then, when he began to think she meant it,
she called him her “knight” and her “hero”
and her “King Arthur” and other frightful
rot, and actually wanted him to wear one of
her Sunday gloves under his shirt at the
time of fighting! Corkey minimus said he
very likely wouldn’t wear a shirt; and
then she thought he might hang it--I
mean the glove--round his neck by a bit
of string!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“Blessed if I shall ever feel quite the
same to her after this,” said Corkey.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems rather rough to get broken up
for life to please a skimpy girl,” I said.
Then he burst out as red in the face as an
apple, and told me he would not hear a word
against Milly, so I dried up.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were three days before the fight,
and Corkey minimus trained for it, and gave
away his pudding at dinner in exchange for
the meat of the chaps who sat next to him.
But you can’t get your muscle up in a day
or two like that, and it only made him awfully
thirsty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day came at last, and I may as well
go on to the fight itself. The First were
having a big match on our own ground, so
nobody paid any attention to us, and we
arranged a game that should have Corkey,
Bray, and me on the same side. Then,
when our chaps were in, we three sneaked
away into the plantations, behind some holly-trees
and a woodstack. Bray arranged all
the preliminaries as cheerful as a bird, and
Blanchard said they were right. They
marked out a ring and ran a string round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>and arranged corners for the seconds; and
I saw that the obscene Fowle had towels
and bottles of water and a basin--all, of
course, for Bray between the rounds. Corkey
minimus was rather waxy with me for
not bringing the same for him; but I’d
brought a sponge, which I know is a thing
a second chucks up in the air when his man
is done for; and I explained and showed
it to Corkey; and he thanked me and said
he supposed that was about the only thing
he should want. Blanchard said the rounds
were to be two minutes long each, and
Bray grumbled because they ought by rights
to be three. But Blanchard told him to
shut up and begin. When we saw Bray take
his shirt off I told Corkey he ought to, and
he did. Then Blanchard laughed and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“By gum! they peel rather different!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Bray was like a barrel, with muscles a lot
bigger than hen’s eggs on his arms. Corkey
minimus seemed to be all ribs somehow,
with arms about as lean as rulers. I told
him to keep moving about and try and puff
Bray a bit if he had time, and he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, I’ll try. If I can get a smack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>at his face, so as to black an eye or something,
and show I’ve hit him before he does
for me, I don’t care.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I will say for Corkey minimus that he
had about the best pluck I ever saw in a
chap. He was quite calm, and just his
usual color; and when Bray tossed him
for corners Corkey won; and Blanchard
said I picked the right corner for him.
Then he told them to fight fair, and said
“Time!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I’d prayed Corkey to try and surprise
Bray at the very start if he could, and have
a hit at Bray’s face the moment they began.
And I’m blessed if he didn’t go and do it!
Bray began fiddling about jolly scientifically
with his hands, and I fancy he just squinted
down to see if his feet were scientific too.
At the same moment Corkey buzzed round
his right and let Bray have it fairly on the
nose. Bray jumped and looked about as
much surprised as if he’d been struck by
lightning; and Blanchard said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“First blood for Corkey minimus!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I yelled--I oughtn’t to have, but I did--because
to see blood dropping about on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Bray’s chest was a fine sight. He sniffed
and went for Corkey smiling. The smile
was the beastliest part of it, for I hoped he
would have got his wool off a bit and been
wild. But he wasn’t, and when he began
to hit, Corkey got flustered and swung about
like a windmill and caught it pretty hot.
Yet he jerked his head so jolly quick that
he didn’t get more than about four smacks
on it in the first round, though his body,
which was white by nature, was pretty soon
covered with red marks. He said they didn’t
hurt, and I cleaned him up and blew water
over him at the end of the round. His lip
was bleeding like mad, but luckily inside,
where his tooth had cut it; and he swallowed
all the blood, so nobody knew; besides
which the blood wasn’t lost. Bray
flung himself down in his corner, and Fowle
looked after him; and even at a solemn
time like that I laughed, and so did Corkey
minimus, because Fowle tried to be too
clever, and spurted a lot of water out of
his mouth into Bray’s eye. Then Bray
told him that after the fight he’d tie him
in knots and kick him, looking forward to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>which, of course, wrecked Fowle’s enjoyment
entirely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Blanchard said “Time!” again awfully
soon, and I saw Bray meant settling Corkey
now, because his reputation as a fighter was
at stake, and he knew Corkey hoped to get
through three rounds with luck. So Bray
began hitting him like hammers, and though
I was about as sorry for Corkey minimus as
a chap could be, nobody would have been
able to help admiring the way Bray hit. It
was just at the end of this round, when
Corkey had been knocked down once, but
got up again, that the awful rum thing with
Milly Dunston happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly, without any warning, there was
a noise like fowls getting up a hedge, and
she rushed out from behind the woodstack
with her eyes blazing and her hair streaming
like a comet in a bate. She’d been running
a good way, I should think, and she tore
right into the ring straight at Bray, and not
trusting to words at a time like that, and
not remembering her father was a clergyman,
or anything, slapped his face both
sides, and jolly hard too. Bray swore the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>horriblest words I ever heard used by a
chap, because she’d given him more in half
a second than Corkey could have in a year.
Then he got into his shirt upside-down and
hooked it with Fowle, but not before he
heard her say:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You little, fat, red-headed coward to
fight and try and murder a boy half your age
and size! I wish I could kill you, I do. It’s
shameful to think you’re an English boy at
all!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she turned on the chaps from the
Fifth, and told Blanchard he was a disgrace
to the school. So they cleared out too; and
then she cried over Corkey, and said she
would rather have been torn to pieces by
unchained monsters than have let him be
mangled like he was. And Corkey, who was
pretty well dazed, forgave her, and told her
kindly to go away. And she gasped and
gurgled, and went.</p>

<p class='c000'>I took Corkey back, and one or two things
got to be known. It came out that Fowle
had told Milly the place and the hour of the
fight, but only after she had sworn--on some
rotten saint Fowle knew--that she would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>tell a single soul about it. She kept her
swear all right, but came herself. And when
Bray got to hear how it was she came--of
course, thinking Corkey had told her, which
he would rather have died than do--then
Bray tried a lot of Chinese tortures on Fowle
that he’d seen at a wax-works. And chaps
who saw it said that Fowle was so excited at
the time that he called upon about twenty
different well-known Bible characters by
name to come and help him and destroy
Bray. But they didn’t.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for Corkey minimus, the things he got
from Milly after that fight you wouldn’t
believe. There were bottles of stuff to rub
bruises with, and lozenges and grapes, and
some muck for his eye, and little baskets
of strawberries, and jolly books and rosebuds.
She told the Doctor about slapping
Bray’s face, and wrote a long letter of apology
afterwards; and a week later she broke
it to Corkey minimus that she was going to
a boarding-school herself next term; which
she did.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Corkey told me about it he added:</p>

<p class='c000'>“And she’s going to write me letters, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>she’s said several times that there’s
only one chap in the world for her now, and
I’m the chap.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shouldn’t think she could change her
mind after all that’s happened,” I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Corkey minimus said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I bet she will when Corkey minor turns
up again, especially if he brings rum things
with him from Australia. And you needn’t
repeat it, but to you, McInnes, as my chum,
I say that I don’t care how soon he does
come back either.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Which showed that there was more sense
in Corkey minimus than you might have
thought.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>The Piebald Rat</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was all the result of old Briggs asking
the Doctor if he might “instil the lads
with a wholesome fondness for natural history.”
That’s how he put it, because I
heard him; and the Doctor said it was an
admirable notion, and would very probably
keep some boys out of mischief on half-holidays.
It also kept some boys out of bounds
on half-holidays; and after a time I think
the Doctor was pretty savage with old Briggs,
and wished he’d stuck to his regular work,
which was writing and drawing and such
like; because, when one or two of the chaps
really got keen about natural history, and
even chucked cricket for butterflies and
beetles, others, who didn’t care a straw
about it, pretended they did to gain their
own ends. And it was these chaps, if you
understand, who finally made the Doctor so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>sick with natural history generally and old
Briggs for starting it.</p>

<p class='c000'>My chum, West, began the rage for study
of “our humble relations,” as old Briggs
called everything down to wood-lice. He
let it be generally known that he had two live
lizards in his desk; and, this being the best
thing that West had ever thought of, the
idea caught on well. I had a dormouse myself,
my name being Ashby minor, and Ashby
major kept a spider pretty nearly as big
as a young bird, which he had poked out of
a hole in the playground wall. He caged
it in a tin match-box, and fed it with blue-bottles
and wasps. At least, he got blue-bottles
and wasps for it, but the fool wouldn’t
eat them; and after a week he found it with
its legs all tucked up as neatly as anything.
Only it was dead. I thought the match-box
must have been too tight a fit for it, but
Ashby major did not. He believed there
was something about a tin match-box which
must be rather poisonous for out-door spiders.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then chaps went on collecting till it got
to be swagger to keep big live things in your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>desk; and the bigger the thing the more
swagger it was.</p>

<p class='c000'>Maine, generally known as Freckles, had
a couple of guinea-pigs in his desk for a week.
Then Mannering, the classical master in the
Fifth, who must have had a nose like a gimlet,
smelt them at prayers, happening to
come in late and kneeling down by Freckles
at the time. The Doctor didn’t make much
fuss then, because that was just at the beginning
of the business; only he said a desk
was not the place for guinea-pigs, and added
that a chap in Freckles’s position in the
school ought to have known it. He let the
gardener look after them from that time
forward. But Freckles naturally lost all
interest in them after the gardener had
them; because a guinea-pig merely <em>as</em> a
guinea-pig is nothing. Anyhow, it was
rough on him to be landed over it, because,
as a matter of fact, guinea-pigs have no
scent worth mentioning, and nobody but
Mannering would have spotted them. After
that Gideon and Brookes caught a blind-worm
one foot two inches long; and Gideon
sold his half for fivepence, so Brookes got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>it all. Nobody knew what a blind-worm
likes to eat, unfortunately, and it died, but
not for a fortnight. Then there was another
scene with my dormouse, which led to tremendous
things. There’s a hole in a desk
where the ink-pot goes in, and one day my
mouse got out through it, having climbed
up two dictionaries and a Greek Testament
to do so. It happened old Briggs himself
was taking the Lower Fourth, which is my
class, and I hoped it would be all right.
But he didn’t seem friendly over it, and I
noticed, when he told us to find the mouse,
he put his feet upon the rungs of his chair.
It’s a rum thing about old Briggs that he
doesn’t care much for natural history objects
while they’re alive; he likes them dead and
dried, or stuffed and pinned on cards, or in
glass cases all labelled and neat. My dormouse
gave us a jolly good hunt round,
then it finally tripped over a lead-pencil and
got its tail and hind legs into West’s ink. So
we caught it, and I was drying it with a piece
of blotting-paper, and old Briggs was just
telling us that dormice belong to a genus
of rodents called Myoxus, and are allied to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>mice, though they have a squirrel’s habits,
which he seemed to think was a pity, when
Dunston came in. The Doctor asked particulars,
looked as if he could have jolly well
killed my mouse, which was shivering rather
badly owing to the ink on its hinder parts,
and said once for all that he would allow no
animals of any kind inside any of the desks
or in school.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, unluckily, as an afterthought, he
demanded a clearance on the spot; and he
was pretty well staggered to find the result.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will ask you, Ferrars, as head boy of
the class, and one, I am happy to think,
above any of this childish folly, to inspect
the desks, one by one, and report to me
where you find indications of life,” said the
Doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ferrars is always right with the Doctor,
chiefly because he has a face like a stone
angel in church, and a very smooth voice,
and a remarkably swagger knowledge of the
Scriptures. He is also a tremendous worker,
and will go into the Upper Fourth next term
as sure as eggs. It was jolly awkward for
Ferrars then, because he happened to be one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>of the keenest natural history chaps of all,
and had a piebald rat, which even fellows in
the Sixth had offered him half-a-crown and
three shillings for, yet he would not part with
it. So, though we didn’t like him much, we
felt almost sorry for the fix he was in now.
Of course, we thought that such a demon on
Religious Knowledge as Ferrars would drag
out his piebald rat right away, and perhaps
even give it to the Doctor, or offer to sell it
for the alms-box; but he didn’t. He got up,
rather white about the gills, and opened the
desks one by one; and a jolly happy family
it was. Only the Doctor scattered the things
to the four winds, till there wasn’t an atom
of natural history left in the whole class-room
except Ferrars’s piebald rat, snug in
his desk.</p>

<p class='c000'>First Fowle, who goes in for water things,
had to empty his jam-jar of tadpoles out
into the playground, which was a beastly
cruel thing to make him do, because they
all died, still being in the gill stage; then
Freckles was sent off with a young rabbit to
the hay-field, and he got caned too, because,
strangely enough, the Doctor hadn’t forgotten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>his guinea-pigs; and Morrant’s two
sparrows were let go, which was no kindness
to them, because Morrant had cut their
wings so jolly short it would have taken
them months to grow enough feathers to fly
with, and meantime a cat got them both;
and Playfair’s mole, which, by-the-way, had
been queer for some time, owing to having
no earth to burrow in, was ordered to be
sent to the cricket-field. There were a lot
of other things, but Corkey minimus scored
rather, because his goat-sucker moth laid a
hundred and fourteen eggs on Todhunter’s
algebra a few hours before it was let free.
Corkey minimus says a goat-sucker moth’s
nothing worth mentioning after it’s laid
eggs, but the eggs turn into fine caterpillars.</p>

<p class='c000'>The few things the Doctor didn’t know
what to do with, and didn’t like to have
killed, he said must be given to the gardener.
He thought it would be better to
put my mouse out of its misery, and turned
it over on my hand with a gold pencil-case,
and said it had probably got a chill
to its vital organs and would die; but old
Briggs explained that it might live if put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>in cotton-wool; so the gardener looked to
it, and it did live, and I took it home at
the end of that term, and have it still,
though it is getting oldish now, and has lost
half its tail. But it’s a good mouse yet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course the extraordinary thing was
Ferrars. After the Doctor had gone, old
Briggs, to whom he had whispered something
before he went, gave out that his natural
history half-hours would be suspended
for the rest of the term; then I got a word
with Ferrars. I said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“However did you have the cheek--you
supposed to be such a saint?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know. Something came over me
to do it. I’ve got a jolly peculiar feeling
to that rat. It’s not an ordinary rat. I’m
wrapped up in it. Even my respect for the
Doctor couldn’t stand against it. I know
what you chaps think. I dare say you reckon
I’m a hound, but I couldn’t help doing
what I did. Somehow that rat’s a sort of
‘mascotte’ to me. A mascotte’s a thing that
brings luck. All my best luck’s happened
since I had it.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Of course, when a chap goes on like that,
what can you do? I didn’t understand Ferrars.
He seemed to me to be simply talking
rot. So I said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, it’s pretty measly, considering the
opinion the Doctor’s got of you. I sha’n’t
try to score off your rat, because I know it’s
a jolly fine one, and I like it; but Freckles
or somebody will very likely kill it after
this.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked in a fair funk when the dreadful
thought of having his rat killed came to
him. Before the end of that day he spoke to
every chap in the class separately, and all
but three promised and swore not to lay a
finger on the rat. But Freckles, Murdoch,
and Morrant wouldn’t swear. Finally he
paid Morrant sixpence and so got him over,
and Murdoch he let crib off him in “prep.”
three times; and Freckles, who was an awfully
sportsmanlike chap really, said he was
only rotting all the time, and would be the
last to do a classy rat like Ferrars’s any harm.
In fact, he said he’d much sooner kill Ferrars
himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mind you, though, of course, it was simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>barbarous for Ferrars to think that his piebald
rat could have any effect on his work,
yet he proved to me that his success in school
and his great popularity with the Doctor
dated from the coming of the thing. When
he first got it, it was a mere cub-rat, so
to say; now, though not a year old, it had
turned into as fine a rat as you could wish
to meet anywhere. In appearance it had
pink eyes and a white head, and a fairish
amount of white fur about the body, which
got thinner on its stomach, so that you could
see the pink skin through to some extent.
But the piebaldness of the rat was the great
feature. It had two big round patches of
fur like the common or garden rat, and one
small patch at the nape of its neck; and in
addition to this it had one large patch of
beautiful yellowish fur, such as you chiefly
see on guinea-pigs. Its tail was pink and
long, and quite hairless.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ferrars often kept back good things at
meals for it, and the bond between them
seemed to grow rummer and rummer, till he
let the rat get on his mind, and Wilson said
he was getting dotty about it. Which I think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>was true, for one day, going into the class-room
to get a knife from my desk, I saw
Ferrars with his rat out, talking to it. He
was swatting like anything in play-hours for
a special Old Testament history prize, and
he had the rat and the Bible and various
books of reference all before him. Then,
not knowing I was there, he spoke:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I must win it, ‘Mayne Reid.’ Stick to
me this time, old chap, and see me through.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He called his rat “Mayne Reid” because
that was his favorite author.</p>

<p class='c000'>And “Mayne Reid” seemed to understand,
and he turned his pink eyes on to
the open Bible and walked over it. Finding
he’d walked over the ninth chapter of
the Second Book of Kings, Ferrars got excited,
and, seeing me, said, “By Jove! then
I’ll learn that chapter by heart, though it is
so long. It’s good, exciting stuff, anyway,
and I bet my rat walking over it means that
there’ll be a question about Jehu and Jezebel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll go cracked about that rat,” I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s part of my life,” he answered. “I
know it seems very peculiar, and so it is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and I don’t suppose such a thing ever happened
before, but something tells me my
prosperity and success is all bound up in
that rat. He’s a familiar spirit, in fact, like
Saul had. If he died I should never do
much more good, and very likely stick in
this class for the rest of my days.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’d better not think like that,” I
said, “because rats are short-lived things,
owing to the nasty food they eat. Not that
‘Mayne Reid’ has nasty food; but all pink-eyed
animals are delicate, and you’ll have to
lose him sooner or later.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Ferrars didn’t take warning by me, but
after he really did win the Old Testament
prize, and there really was a question about
Jezebel, he made a sort of idol out of the
rat, and some chaps declared he said his
prayers to it. I know he constantly bought
it cocoa-nut chips, which it was very fond
of. He trained it, too, to live in his breast-pocket,
and I often saw him glancing down
in class just to get a glimpse of its little eyes
looking up at him. That taking the piebald
rat into class shows the lengths Ferrars ran.
The whole thing was very peculiar. Some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>chaps said there was a strong likeness growing
up between Ferrars and the rat; and
certainly his thin, white face had a rattish
look sometimes. Other fellows told him his
rat was an evil spirit, and would end by
doing him a bad turn, but Ferrars turned
upon them and jawed them with such frightful
language that they never said it again.
Meanwhile the Doctor went on taking to
Ferrars more and more, and there seemed
every chance of his getting the whole Bible
by heart before he left Merivale.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then came the end of the affair like this.
Ferrars was so dependent on his rat now
that he wouldn’t do a lesson without it, and
he lugged it fearlessly into the Doctor’s
study at those times, fortunately rare, when
the Doctor took our class himself in Scripture.
But Ferrars was such a flyer that we
all got tarred with the same brush; and the
Doctor, after questioning Ferrars for half an
hour about Bible people we’d never even
heard of, and getting a string of dead-right
answers out of him, would dismiss us all in
great good temper, forgetting that he’d only
been having a go at one chap.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>A day came when the Doctor left us for
five minutes in the middle of this class, and
while most of us had a hurried dip into the
plagues of Egypt, which was the business
in hand, Ferrars, who knew as much about
the plagues as ever Moses did, just got out
his rat and gave it a bit of almond and a
short breather of a yard or so along the
floor. But, the Doctor coming back suddenly,
he had only just time to pop it into
his pocket, and even then he put the rat
into an unusual pocket which it was not
accustomed to, and didn’t like, namely, a
trouser-pocket. Ferrars also shoved a
handkerchief down in the pocket to steady
the rat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then I saw an awful rum expression
come over him, and he grabbed at the
pocket and his mouth fell open, and his face
got the color of new putty. At the same
time I saw his eyes turn to a big bookshelf
with glass doors against the side of the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s the matter, Ferrars?” said the
Doctor. “You appear unwell.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing, sir; merely a little passing
sickness, I think.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“Then withdraw, my boy, and ask the
matron to give you a few drops of brandy
and water. You need not dine to-day,” said
the Doctor, very kindly.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Ferrars wouldn’t withdraw. He knew
“Mayne Reid” had got through his pocket
and down his trouser-leg; he also knew it was
now behind the bookshelf, and might reappear
at any moment. So he said he was
better, and, actually! that it would be a
grief to him to miss one of the Doctor’s own
lessons.</p>

<p class='c000'>But afterwards, when the rat didn’t come
out and the class was dismissed, Ferrars was
frightful to see. His hair all got on end
somehow, and his eyes swelled and stuck out
of his head like glass beads, and his cheeks
got hollow. He ran awful risks going into
the Doctor’s study that day, but the rat
wouldn’t come out, and Ferrars looked old
enough to be a master when he went to bed,
though only eleven and a half really.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One of two things has happened,” he
said to me, for we were in the same dormitory;
“either it’s got wedged in behind
the bookshelf and will die if not let out, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>else there was a rat-hole there, and it went
down and has joined common rats, and become
a sort of king rat among them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Or been killed,” I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, they would not kill it,” he answered.
“Anyway, to-morrow, after the Doctor’s class
is over, and everybody has gone, I shall stop
and make a clean breast of it, and ask him,
for the sake of humanity, to have the bookshelf
moved. But it’s all up with me if the
rat has lost its feeling towards me and won’t
come back; only if it was stuck and couldn’t
come back, that’s different.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He didn’t sleep much that night, but he
said some prayers, which was a thing he
didn’t often do; and of course he was praying
that the piebald rat might be allowed to
return.</p>

<p class='c000'>But next day, after the Scripture class, in
which Ferrars was not nearly so much to
the front as usual, and got regularly muddled
over a potty question about Jacob, the
Doctor saved him the trouble of asking
about his rat. He--the Doctor, I mean--had
been jolly glum all through class, and
when it was ended he did a rum thing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>which was awful to see, knowing all we did.
He told us to keep our places, then went
to the fireplace and picked up the shovel.
From the face of it he removed a bit of newspaper,
and under the newspaper was “Mayne
Reid.” His pink eyes had gone foggy, and
there was a little streak of blood on his
mouth. Otherwise his body looked all right.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now here,” said the Doctor, in an
awfully solemn way, “we have a dead, piebald
rat. There can be no outlet for error
concerning such a rat as this. To have seen
such a rat is to remember it. Already three
classes have been before me to-day, but nobody
knew anything about this animal. That
it was a tame rat its fatness and sleekness
testify. Moreover, the piebald rat is an outcome
of artificiality. A wild rat in a state of
nature is brown or black, as the case may
be. This rat, then, had an owner, and that
owner brought it into my study--<em>my study!</em>--and
suffered it to escape here. That I do
well to be angry you will the more easily
understand when I tell you that the unsavory
creature was upon my desk last
night, and has scratched and even eaten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>some papers whereon were notes for my
next sermon. It was discovered this morning
by one of the domestics. She, seeing
some object moving upon my desk, struck
with the broom-handle, and destroyed this
rat. Now let there be no prevarication or
evasion of the questions I am going to put
to you. First, I wish to know if this rat
belongs, or rather belonged, to any among
you; and, secondly, I desire to learn whether,
supposing the rat be not the property of any
present, you happen to know whose property
it is, or rather was?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I stole a look at Ferrars, and he appeared
so frightful to see, that for some reason I
thought I’d try and help him. So, like a
fool, I was just going to speak when young
Corkey minimus did. He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Please, sir, it might be a foreign sort of
rat that came over in that box of pineapples
and things that Ashby major had sent him
from the West Indies.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“When I desire your aid in the elucidation
of this problem I will apply for it,
Corkey minimus,” answered the Doctor, so
Corkey dried up.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Then, in a sort of voice that was strange
to us, and seemed to come from his stomach
or somewhere new, Ferrars spoke, and I
never saw a chap look so ghastly. His eyes
were fixed on the rat, and he came forward
slowly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Please, sir, it was my rat,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yours, Ferrars! <em>You</em> to disobey! You,
of all boys, to set my orders at defiance!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It wasn’t an ordinary rat, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can see what sort of rat it was, sir, for
myself,” thundered the Doctor. “This it
is to consider a boy, to devote thought to
him, to particularly commend him for his
theological knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t take any credit for knowing anything
now, sir. It was the rat as much as me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Robert Ferrars!” said the Doctor, in his
caning voice, “you are now adding wicked
buffoonery to an act in itself sufficiently disreputable!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t explain, sir; I don’t mean any
buffoonery. That rat was more to me than
you’d think. It--it <em>did</em> help me somehow,
and now it’s dead it wouldn’t be sportsmanlike
to it to say not. And if you’ll let me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>b-bury it properly, I’ll be very thankful to
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Doctor looked at Ferrars awfully close
during this speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Either you are lying,” he said, “or you
suffer from some hysterical and neurotic
condition, Robert Ferrars, which I have
neither suspected nor discovered until this
moment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he told us to go; but Ferrars he
kept for half an hour; and when Ferrars
came in to dinner I saw he’d been blubbing.</p>

<p class='c000'>He explained to me after we’d gone to
bed. He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, he didn’t cane me or anything. He
just talked, and told me a lot about several
things I didn’t know, and said that familiar
spirits were specially barred in the Bible.
I never thought he’d have even tried to understand
me; but he did, and he quite saw
my side about the rat. He said kind words
over it, too, and was sorry it was dead. And
I’ve got to see Doctor Barnes to-morrow too,
though, of course, it’s only having my rat
on my mind that’s upset me. And he let
me have it to b-bury gladly.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Where shall you arrange the rat?” I
said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m sending it home in a stays-box that
Jane gave me. I’ve written to my sister
where to bury it. Jane it was who killed
it. She cried like anything when I told
her what ‘Mayne Reid’ was to me. But
he’s in the book-post by now, beautifully
done up in shavings and fresh geranium
leaves. It’s no good talking any more.
Only I will say that if he was a familiar
spirit, he was a jolly good one, very different
to the sort barred in the Scriptures. I
don’t know how I’ll get on in the exams.
now. I wish I was dead, too.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he sniffed a bit, and went to sleep.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>Browne, Bradwell, and Me</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There’s more stuff torked about fagging
at school than anything else in the
world, as far as I can see; and being the
smalest boy but two at Dunston’s, and a fag
myself, I ought to know. Of corse, fags do
get it pretty hot sometimes if they happen
to fag for a beast, but big fellows aren’t
beasts to small ones as a general thing. I’m
sure Bradwell was the best chap that ever
came to Dunston’s, and when he was expelled
over the seege in the Wing Dormatery--him
and Trelawny--I felt frightful. I’m
Watson minor myself, my brother being
Watson major, one of the reserves for the
second eleven and captain of the third.</p>

<p class='c000'>The thing I’m going to write out happened
just before the seege, and was all over before
that; and it shows what a fag can do. It
also shows what a jolly good thing it is for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>big fellows to treat fags well, and give them
odds and ends so as to get their affecksun.
If I hadn’t felt what I did to Bradwell, I
shouldn’t have run the awful risks I did for
him. What I did certinly ruined a great
project of Bradwell’s, and upsett him a good
bit at the time. But he said afterwards,
when the blow had fallen, and when he could
look back and think of it without smacking
my head, that I had ment well. I remember
his very words, for that matter. He
said, “Your intenshuns were all right--I
will say that--but you’ve ruined my life.”
No chap could say farer than that; and,
mind you, I did ruin his life in a way. I’ve
heard many fellows say Bradwell was a
bounder by birth; but he never was to
me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, Bradwell had a great admeration
for Mabel Dunston, the Doctor’s youngest
daughter but one, and she had an equal
great admeration for him, for two terms.
Bradwell, although a great sportsman in
other ways, was fond of girls. If he passed
a school of them he would look awfully rum
and reddish in the face an’ watery in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>eyes. Once, going with him to the playing-field
for a football match, he made the distance
half a mile longer by going up a side-street
to avoid the high-school girls; and I
asked him why, and he said it was cheek, but
told me all the same. He said, “You can’t
meet women got up like this.” Bradwell has
frightfully thin calves to his legs when seen
in “knickers,” though he is the best goalkeeper
that was ever known at Dunston’s.
Of course, his affair with Mabel Dunston
would never have got to be known by me but
for my great use to Bradwell in carrying
notes. Being in the Doctor’s house that
term I was easily able to do this, and there
was a jar of green stuff in the hall where she
told me to leave the notes, which I did. She
was fifteen, I believe, or else sixteen, but
well on in years anyway, and a few months
older than Bradwell. It was his general
brillance won her, for he could do anything,
and his father had plenty of money, being a
man like Whitely’s in London, only in the
North of England. Bradwell drew almost
as well as pictures in books, and he used to illustrate
the Latin grammar for his special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>chums. There’s a part of the Latin grammar
called Syntax, which I haven’t come to
yet myself, but it has rather rummy things
in it, with both the Latin and English of
them. And Bradwell used to illustrate these
things; and he illustrated two in my grammar
out of puer kindness to me. One was,
“Balbus is crowning the boy’s head with a
garland”; and the other was, “A snake appeared
to Sulla while sacrifising”; and you
never saw anything better. They were done
on the margin in ink, and the snake appearing
to Sulla was about the queerest and best
thing even seen in a Latin grammar.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have to tell you this because such a lot
happened owing to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now Browne took my class, which is the
lowest in the school, and I am seventh in
it. And I gradually got to hate Browne,
because Bradwell did, and for other reesons
of my own to. Browne was said to be only
twenty-two, and he looked younger than
many of the chaps, his moustashe being
whitish and invisibel to the eye. He wore
necktyes which I remember hearing Mathers
say were an insult to nature, and would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>have made a rainbow curl up and faint. We
always noticed, at arithmetic times, that
Browne, if he got a stumper, would put up
the lid of his private desk and hide behind
it--of course, looking the thing up in his
crib. Then he would wander round, as if
by accident, to the chap and do the sum off
quick while he remembered it. Bradwell
always hated him; and when he found that
Browne was very friendly with Mabel and
Mabel was very friendly with Browne, he
hated him far, far wurse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bradwell and this girl had a row in the
shrubbery at the back of the chapel, and
I, being in the gardener’s potting-shed at
the time, feeding a cattipiller of mine, heard
it. Bradwell said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m not blind, Mabel, I’ve seen it going
on ever since last term. You read his beastly
books, and leave rosebuds with scented
verbena leaves round them in that stone
urn at the gate when he comes down from
his house to class.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And she said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“And why shouldn’t I? You must remember,
please, that I am my own mistress.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Besides, the intelligents of a grown-up man
is very refreshing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For some reason Bradwell didn’t like this.
His voice squeaked up into his head in a
rather rum way when he answered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“D’you call <em>him</em> a man? He hasn’t got
a muscle on him; and he doesn’t know more
than enough to teach the kids.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s merely mean jellousy,” said Mabel.
“Of course, he doesn’t talk to <em>you</em>, or
show you what is in him. But he tells me
all about his secret life, and very butiful it
is. He is a jenius, in fact.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If it comes to that, what can he do?”
said Bradwell, awfully clevverly. “Can he
draw?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, he doesn’t draw.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh! can he sing?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can he play the piano?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Now all of these things Bradwell could
do to perfecksun, so he got cheerfuller and
cheerfuller.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What <em>can</em> he do, then, besides jaw the
kids and always sneak to the Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“I never saw such jellousy as this,” said
Mabel; “but if you must know I’ll tell you
what he can do: he can write poetry out of
his own head, and he has got a solid book of
it reddy to print some day--there!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I suppose Bradwell couldn’t write poetry.
Anyway, he got very down in the face at
this. He didn’t say anything--appeering to
be frightfully shocked at what he’d heard.
Then Mabel said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“When you can quote Browning and Byron
and Shelley, and write poems yourself, it will
be soon enough to sneer at Mr. Browne.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You love him,” said Bradwell, in a very
tragik voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t love anybody but my own family,”
said Mabel; “but I admire him, and I
admire his poetry, which is very much out
of the common indeed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s all over then, I suppose,” said
Bradwell.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know what you mean,” she replied
to him. “A thing that has never
begun can’t be all over”; which words of
Mabel’s seemed to knock the heart out of
Bradwell.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Then the gardener came along, and I
didn’t hear anything else. Of corse, I
couldn’t <em>help</em> hearing what I had done,
though I tried hard not to, and kept feeding
my catterpeller like anything all the
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two days after I had to carry another
note to Mabel, and found one waiting for
Bradwell in the usual place; so they must
have made it up. Then came the beginning
of my misforchunes with Browne. He found
the snake appeering to Sulla in my Latin
grammar, and called me up and said he
knew very well I hadn’t drawn it myself,
but wanted to know who had. He said it
was wrong to the Doctor to ruin our books,
and that he had seen in several different
books the same snake, evidently done by the
same boy, owing to them being so much
similar.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the very identical thing had happened
in another class--to Steggles, Bradwell
having drawn him the same picture;
and knowing what Steggles said, being a
chap who is frightfully cunning, I said the
same now to Browne. I said I left the book
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>on my desk, and somebody came along and
done it while I was out of the room. Browne
seemed inclined not to believe this. Anyway,
he took the Latin grammar away with
him. But I heard no more about it till the
next evening, when I wanted the book in
prep. Remembering Browne had it, I went
off to his study and knocked and walked in.</p>

<p class='c000'>Browne wasn’t there for the moment, and
the room was empty. I took the opportunity
to look at a rather butiful tobacco-jar
of Browne’s which I have seen at a distance
on his mantlepiece many times. Passing
his table to get to it, I chanced to glance
there, and juge of my surprise when the
first words I saw at the top of a big sheet of
paper were, "To Mabel"! Underneeth was
a lot of writing, and the whole table seemed
to be littered with paper covered with small
bits of separate writing, much of it scratched
out and done over again. But the piece
with “To Mabel” at the top was all butiful
and clean, without anything scratched,
being, I suppose, the result of all the other
bits put together and neetly copied out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, there I was with my duty towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Bradwell as his fag. Browne had evidently
done a verse out of his own head for Mabel
Dunston, and had written it in this butiful
style, on thick white paper, to send to her.
I felt if she got it, knowing what she’d said
to Bradwell about Browne, that it was certin
she would abbandon Bradwell, him not being
any good at poems. I wouldn’t have
done it for anybody else in the world <em>but</em>
Bradwell; I wouldn’t have done it at all
if I had known what the end of it was
going to be; but, anyway, at the time it
seemed to me, as Bradwell s fag, I ought to
do it; so I did.</p>

<p class='c000'>I took the poem and rolled it up so as not
to hurt it, and hooked off to Bradwell. He
was in his study, and Trelawny, who shares
it with him, being out of the room, I was
able to explain. I said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you please, Bradwell, I’ve come from
Mr. Browne’s study, and he was not there,
and happening by a curious axcident to
glance on the table I saw this. Knowing
about you and Mabel, and being your fag, I
took it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Took what?” said Bradwell.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>I put the thing in front of him, and he got
red and excited.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a poem to Mabel by that beast
Browne,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he read it out, half to himself, but
I heard. The thing ran like this:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>"TO MABEL</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh let my Muse sing to the name of Mabel,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Whose azure eyes are fastened to my soul,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Like to forget-me-nots in button-hole.</div>
      <div class='line'>To tell of my heart’s torment I’m unable.</div>
      <div class='line'>My thoughts they spin; my brain it grows unstable</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When fixed on Thee. Perchance it is my rôle</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Never to reach my mad ambition’s Goal,</div>
      <div class='line'>But to live ever ’midst scholastic babel.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thy glances brighten all my lonely lot.</div>
      <div class='line'>Prometheus-like a vulture gnaws my heart,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In biting blasts and under sunshine hot.</div>
      <div class='line'>My dreams are shattered by a barbed dart,</div>

      <div class='line'>Whisper the oaths I yearn to Thee impart.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I told Bradwell I didn’t quite understand
it, and he sat on me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You wouldn’t,” he said, “a kid like you.
But I do. It’s a sonnit, and an extramly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>fine one. I <em>hate</em> the chap, but it’s no good
pretending he’s not a poet, because this jolly
well proves he is. Look at the rimes and
the smoothness!”</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed a heroik thing of Bradwell to
say that, feeling as he did to Browne. He
thought for a bit, but told me not to go.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of corse,” he said, “this must be returned.
All’s fair in--in a case of this kind,
but--”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he thought very deeply and read
the sonnit again. Suddenly he took a bit
of paper and copied down Browne’s poem
word for word. Then he told me to cut
back like lightning to Browne’s study, and
to put the poem back on his desk if I could--if
not, to most carefully keep it till the
first chance of getting it back to Browne’s
room without being spotted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re a splendid fag,” he said, “and
I shan’t forget this. It’s the sort of thing
that squires did for their knights in olden
times; and they got good rewards too. Now
hook it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It’s worth a lot, mind you, to get praise
like that from such a chap as Bradwell.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>When I got back, Browne was rumaging
over his table and sweering a good deal in a
loud wisper. He told me to wait a minute,
and went off to look in his bedroom. Then
I seezed my opportunity, and slipped the
sonnit on his table under some papers.
When he came back he was worried, and
went on hunting till he found it. Then he
said “Ah!” to himself, and got pleasanter
and asked me what I wanted. I told him
my Latin grammar, and, being in a very
happy state now, owing to finding the poem,
he gave my book back and told me to clear
out; which I did.</p>

<p class='c000'>After prep. I met Bradwell going in to
prayers, and he handed me a note for Mabel
to put in the usual place. He looked awfully
rum when he gave it to me, and he
saw that I saw he looked rum. So he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t mind letting you know, owing
to your being such a good fag and my
trusting you as I do. You may read the
letter in prayers, then seal it down and put
it behind the pot of ferns in the hall in the
usual place.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of corse, it wasn’t really a letter, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Bradwell wouldn’t have let me read it. It
was just Browne’s sonnit coppied out by
Bradwell word for word; and at the bottom
where the words, “What about poetry now?--A.
T. B.” A. T. B. are Bradwell’s initials,
his full name being Arthur Thomas Bradwell.
You see, he didn’t exsaxtly say he’d
<em>written</em> the sonnit. He only said, “What
about poetry now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The excitement of it all kept me awake
for hours and hours through the night. I
don’t suppose any fag ever did more for a
big fellow than I had done for Bradwell that
day. Then I began to wonder when Browne
would send off his poem, and wether Mabel
would get them both together or one at
a time. You see, of corse, Browne would
send her the thing as original, and there
was nothing in Bradwell’s letter to exsaxtly
say he hadn’t written it; and puzzling the
thing out for hours and hours, I at last
came to the conklusion that she would find
it very difficult which to believe, because
how could she know which was telling the
truth to her? Then, about three or four in
the morning almost, I began to feel rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>terrible over it, because I thought of what
frightful trouble Browne must have had to
write the sonnit. He might have taken
terms and terms over it for all I could tell,
not, of corse, knowing myself how long it
took to write poetry. I felt rather sorry for
Browne; but after all a chap’s duty is to the
fellow he fags for before masters; and feeling
that, I went to sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three days later Bradwell had me in his
room and told me the end of it all, which
shows that a girl never does what you might
exspect.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As a lesson to you, young Watson,” said
Bradwell, “I may tell you that my career
has been utterly blighted and my life ruined
by that business of the sonnit.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I said I was sorry to hear it.</p>

<p class='c000'>He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, blighted; and so’s his--I mean
Browne’s. She got my letter that night
and his next morning. That night she felt
all her old feeling for me return because of
the sonnit, thinking I’d done it. Then,
next morning, she got just the very same
stuff to a word from Browne, with a letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>saying he had burned the midnight oil to
compose it. Well, there you are. What
does she do? Insted of accepting my
statement, being the first, she argues in a
most elaborate way that I couldn’t possibly
have coppied from Browne, and Browne
couldn’t possibly have copied from me.
But it would have been to much of a coinsidence
if we’d both written exsaxtly the
same sonnit out of our own heads, so what
does she conklude?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I said I didn’t know.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, fathead, that we both coppied it
from somebody else--out of some book by
some well-known proper dead poet. I’ve no
doubt now, on thinking over it, that Browne
<em>did</em> do that; because when I first read his
poem I could hardly believe that he had
written such real poetry, owing to the rimes
and smoothness. But it’s all over now.
She’s written a letter I can’t show you. To
hope even for her friendship wouldn’t be
any good. A girl hates a joke something
frightful.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How about Browne?” I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She’s written to him also, asking him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>where he got the verses out of, and exsplaining
she doesn’t believe they are original, and
saying how another acquaintance of hers
had sent the very same lot the day before.
So now you see what a sinful mess you’ve
made of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I said I did, but I felt it was my duty to
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I know,” he said; “but the question
is, What do I do now? You see ‘all’s
fair’ and all that; but now, being out of
the hunt, ought I to throw up the sponge
and tell the truth, or ought I not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know, Bradwell,” I said; “but
anyway you won’t mention me, I hope, because
I only acted for you, and did a jolly
dangerous thing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, you’re safe enough, and, in fact, I’m
going to reward you for what you <em>did</em> do,”
said Bradwell. “But seeing I’m out of it,
I think it will be a manly act to Browne if I
tell Mabel frankly that I resorted to strateji.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But me?” I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall merely inform her,” answered
Bradwell, “that one of my emissaceries
found the poem, and, of course, brought it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>to me; that I despatched it--as a joke, taking
care not to say I was the auther. I shall
end with these words: ‘Browne is innosent.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>All of which he did, and I left the letter
in the usual spot. But Mabel cut him altogether
from that day; and he told me girls
have no humer and laughed it off, though
he felt it a lot, and often smacked my head
out of bitterness of mind afterwards, but
not hard. He gave me an old knife for a
reward, but told me at the same time never
to do anything for him again without being
commanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for Mabel, she threw over Browne just
like she threw over Bradwell, in spite of
Bradwell’s letter; and Bradwell said it was
a nemmecis, whatever that is; and I had
a nemmecis to, because a week afterwards
Bradwell threw over me and made young
West his fag. I felt hert, but, of corse, that
didn’t get known to Bradwell; and if I fag
again, I wont so much as make a peece of
toste unless I’m commanded to.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>Gideon’s Front Tooth</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I believe Gideon was the only Jew
that ever came to Dunston’s, and I expect,
taking it all round, he might have had
a better time at a school for Jews in general;
though in one way he wouldn’t have done as
well, and wouldn’t have had the adventure
with old Grimbal, which turned out so splendidly
for him when old Grimbal died.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though easily the richest chap at Merivale,
and getting no less than ten shillings a
week pocket-money, Gideon was so awfully
fond of coin that he hardly spent a penny,
and the only thing he did with his money
was to lend it to fellows. He didn’t lend it
for nothing, having a curious system by
which you paid in marbles, or bats, or
knives for the money, and, in spite of that,
still had to pay back the money itself after
a certain time. You signed a paper, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Gideon said that if chaps hadn’t paid back
the tin on the dates named it would be very
serious for them. But it got serious for him
after a bit, because Steggles, who knew quite
as much about money as Gideon (though he
never had any), borrowed a whole pound
once, and promised to pay five shillings for
it for one term; and Gideon was new to
Steggles then, and agreed. But when the
time of payment came, Steggles said that
Gideon had better regard it as a bad debt,
because he wasn’t going to pay back even
the original pound. Then Gideon thought
a bit, and asked him why, and Steggles told
him. He said: “Because you know jolly
well the Doctor doesn’t allow chaps to lend
money.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Gideon said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is the first time I’ve heard that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Anyway, it’s usury, which is a crime,”
said Steggles, “and I’m not going to pay
anything; and, being less than twenty-one,
you can’t make me; so it amounts to
a bad debt, as I told you just now. You’ve
done jolly well, one way and another, and
you’ve got two bats, and Lord knows how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>many india-rubber-balls, and cricket-balls,
and silver pencils, and knives out of it, including
Ashby minor’s watch-chain, which is
silver; and if you take my tip you’ll keep
quiet, because once all these kids get to know
anybody under twenty-one can borrow money
without returning it, then it’s all up with
your beastly financial schemes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gideon was remarkably surprised to know
what a lot Steggles had found out about
him, and accused him of looking into his
play-chest; and Steggles said he had. Then
Gideon went; and about three chaps who
had heard the talk told others, and they told
still more chaps, until, finally, a good many
fellows who owed Gideon money felt there
was no hurry about paying it back till it
happened to be convenient. In fact, Gideon
jolly soon saw he couldn’t do any more good
for himself like that, and at the beginning
of the next term, when chaps were pretty
flush of coin, he wrote up in the gym,
“There will be a sale of bats, knives, and
other various useful articles, between two
and three o’clock, by auction, on Tuesday.--<span class='sc'>J.
Gideon.</span>”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Somebody tore it down, but not before
most fellows had read it; and when Gideon
and young Miller, who had a bat in the
auction, and hoped to get it back if possible,
were seen carrying Gideon’s play-chest to
the gym after dinner on the appointed day,
of course we went. It passed off very well
for Gideon, because the things were really
good, and often almost new. He seemed
to know all about auctions, and hit the chest
with a stump, and explained the things, and
what good points they had about them.
He only took money down, and I will say
nobody could have done it fairer. If a knife
had a broken blade, for instance, or a bat
was slightly sprung, which happened with
one, he always pointed it out, so that nobody
could say he had been choused over it.
Young Miller got back his bat for four
shillings and eightpence; and Ashby minor
got back his silver chain for thirteen shillings;
but it wasn’t much good to him, because,
in order to raise the thirteen bob, he
had to raffle the chain at once, at shilling
shares; and he took one, hoping to be lucky,
but he wasn’t, Fowle unfortunately getting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>it. Gideon told me afterwards that the sale
came out fairly, but not quite what he had
hoped. He rather sneered at the Dunston
chaps in general, and said they were a poverty-stricken
crew; which got me into a bate,
and I told him that I’d sooner be the son of
an officer in the Royal Navy, which I am,
than the biggest Jew diamond dealer in the
world, his father being in that profession.
He said there was no accounting for tastes,
but he should have thought that a man who
could deliberately go and be a sailor must
be weak in the head. Then I punched him,
and he instantly went down and apologized.
I may mention that I am Bray, the cock of
the Lower School.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before coming to Gideon’s front tooth,
just to let you know exactly the chap he
was, I’ll mention another thing he did. An
old woman was allowed to bring up fruit
and tuck generally, and sell it to us after
morning school. Steggles, who knows the
reason for pretty nearly everything, said
this was permitted by Doctor Dunston to
take the edge off our appetites; but anyway,
the old woman sold strawberries and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>raspberries in summer-time, and these were
arranged with cabbage-leaves in little wicker
baskets at about fourpence each. Well, one
day Gideon, who never refused to eat fruit
if offered it, but very seldom bought any,
asked the old woman what she gave for
the wicker baskets, and she said threepence
a dozen. Then he asked her what she
would give for those which had been used
once, and she thought, and said they
would be worth at least three halfpence a
dozen to her. He didn’t say any more, but
after that it was a rum thing how all the
used baskets, which generally were seen
kicking about the playground in shoals,
disappeared. Nobody noticed it at the
time, but afterwards we remembered clearly
that they <em>had</em> disappeared. And just at the
end of the term a chap, hurrying in late after
the bell rang, came bang on Gideon and
the old woman round a corner out of sight
of the gates. And the chap saw Gideon
give her a pile of baskets and get three halfpence.
Of course, it was the last three
halfpence he ever got that way, because
when it became known the chaps rendered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>their baskets useless for commerce in many
ways. And Barlow called Gideon “Shylock
minor” when he heard that he’d made two
shillings and fivepence halfpenny; which
name stuck to Gideon forever. And Steggles
got nine other chaps to subscribe a
penny each and buy a pound of flesh from
a butcher’s shop, because in Shakespeare
Shylock was death on his pound of flesh.
The pound was put under Gideon’s pillow
by Steggles himself, and when Gideon
shoved his watch under his pillow, which
he always did at night, he found it; and
Steggles says he turned pale, but read what
was pinned on the pound of flesh, and then
smiled and wrapped the meat up in a letter
from home, and said: “What fools you
chaps are, wasting money like that! But
it looks all right, and will mean a good feed
for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Next day he got up very early and took
his pound of flesh down to the kitchen and
got them to cook it; and he ate about half
before breakfast and had the rest cold in his
desk during Monsieur Michel’s lesson, which
was a safe time. And Steggles said we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>ought to have gone one better and put
poison on it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great affair of the tooth came on at
the beginning of next term; and first I must
tell you that next door to Dunston’s lived an
old man, so frightfully ancient that his skin
was all shrivelled over his bones. He didn’t
like boys much, but he would look over his
garden-wall sometimes into our playground
and scowl if anybody caught his eye. Various
things, of course, went over the wall
often, and it was one of the excitements of
Dunston’s to go into old Grimbal’s garden
and get them back. Twice only he caught
a chap, and both times, despite his awful
age and yellowness of skin, he thrashed the
chap very fairly hard with a walking-stick;
but he never reported anybody to Dunston,
and it was generally thought he regarded
it as a sort of sport hunting for chaps in his
garden. Of course, in fair, open hunting he
hadn’t a chance, and the two he did catch
he got by stealth, hiding behind bushes on
a rather dark evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, the facts would never have been
known about this tooth but for Gideon’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>mean spirit. It happened to be necessary
for him to fight me, and though not caring
much about it, he couldn’t help himself.
Besides, though the champion of the Lower
School, I was tons smaller than Gideon, and
Gideon didn’t know till after the fight that
I was a champion, the true facts about my
greatness being hid from him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just before the fight Gideon said: “Oh!
my tooth, by the way. It may be hurt, and
it cost my father five guineas.” So, to our
great interest he unscrewed one of his two
top front teeth and gave it to his second.
You couldn’t have told it was a sham, so remarkably
was it done, and it screwed on to
the foundation of the original tooth much
like a spike screws into the sole of a cricket-boot.
Gideon had fallen down-stairs when
he was ten and knocked off half the tooth,
so he told us; but Murray, who is well up
in science, said that all Jews’ front teeth
are rather rocky, because in feudal times
they were pulled out with pincers as a form
of torture, and to make the Jews give up
their secret treasures. Murray said that
after many generations of pulling out Nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>got sick of it, and that in modern times
the front teeth of Jews aren’t worth talking
about. Murray is full of rum ideas like that,
and he hopes to go in for engineering, having
already many secret inventions waiting
to be patented.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to Gideon, I licked him rather badly
in two rounds and a half. Then he was
mopped up and dressed, and screwed in
his front tooth again with the greatest
ease.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once it got known about this tooth, and
fellows were naturally excited. Steggles
said it was on the principle of a tobacco-pipe
mouthpiece; and, finding the chaps
were keen to see it, Gideon let it be generally
known he would freely show it to anybody
for threepence a time, and to friends
for twopence. But this was a safe reduction
to make, because, properly speaking,
he hadn’t any friends. Seeing there were
nearly 200 boys at Dunston’s, and that certainly
half, including several fellows from
the Sixth, took a pleasure in seeing the
tooth, and didn’t mind the rather high
charge, Gideon did jolly well; and in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>case of Nubby Tomkins, he made actually
one shilling and threepence; because the
tooth had a most peculiar fascination for
Nubby, and he saw it no less than five
times. After that Gideon made a reduction
to him, as well he might. But somehow
Slade, the head of the school, was very
averse to Gideon’s front tooth when he
heard about it, and he decided that there
must be no more exhibitions of it for money.
He told Gideon so himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, a new boy came a week afterwards
and heard about the strangeness of
the tooth, and offered a shilling, in three
instalments, to see it; which was too much
temptation for Gideon, and he showed it,
contrary to what Slade had said.</p>

<p class='c000'>Slade, of course, heard, for the new boy
happened to be his own cousin, though
called Saunders; and then there was a
curious scene in the playground, which I
fortunately saw. Slade came up to Gideon
in the very quiet way he has, and asked him
in a perfectly gentlemanly voice for his front
tooth. At first Gideon seemed inclined not
to give it up, but he saw what an awfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>serious thing that would be, and finally unscrewed
it, though not willingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now,” said Slade, “I’ll have no more of
this penny peep-show business at Merivale.
I told you once, and you have disobeyed me.
So there’s an end of your beastly tooth.
What’s this?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He took something out of his pocket.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a catapult,” said Gideon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is,” said Slade, “and I’m going to use
your tooth instead of a bullet, and fire it
into space.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It cost five guineas,” said Gideon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t care if it cost a hundred,” answered
Slade, still in a very gentlemanly
sort of way. “We can’t have this sort of
thing here, you know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Slade was just going to fire into space, as
he had said, when a robin suddenly settled
within thirty yards of us, on the wall between
the playground and old Grimbal’s.
Slade being a wonderful shot with a catapult
(having once shot a wood-pigeon), suddenly
fired at the robin, and only missed it
by about four inches. He said the shape of
a front tooth was very unfavorable for shooting.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>But, anyway, the tooth went over into
Grimbal’s, and we distinctly heard it hit
against the side of his house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Slade went away, and we rotted
Gideon rather, because not having the tooth
looked rum, and made a difference in his
voice. He took it very quietly, and said he
rather thought his father would be able to
summon Slade; and before evening school,
having marked down the spot where he
fancied his tooth had hit Grimbal’s house,
he went to look with a box of matches.
What happened afterwards he told us frankly;
and it was certainly true, because, with
all his faults, Gideon never lied to anybody.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I went quietly over, and began carefully
looking along the bottom of the wall, using
a match to every foot or so,” he said, "and
I had done about half when I heard a door
open. I then hooked it, and ran almost on
to old Grimbal. He had not opened the
door at all, but was coming up the garden
path at the critical moment. Of course, he
caught me. He was going to rub it into me
with his stick, when I said I should think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>it very kind if he would hear me first, as I
had a perfectly good excuse for being there.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>"‘What excuse can you have for trespassing
in my garden, you little oily wretch?’</p>

<p class='c000'>"‘Oily wretch’ was what he called me;
and I said that my tooth had been fired into
his garden that very day, about half-past one,
by a chap with a catapult; and I lighted a
match and showed him it was missing.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>"‘How the deuce are you going to find
a tooth in a garden this size?’ And I told
him I had marked it down very carefully,
and that it had cost five guineas, and that
I rather believed my father would be able
to summon the chap who had shot it away.
He seemed a good deal interested, and said
he thought very likely he might, if it was
robbery with violence. Then he asked me
if I was the boy he had seen beating down
the price of a purse at Wilkinson’s in Merivale,
and I said I was. Then he said,
‘Come in and have a bit of cake, boy’; and
I went in and had a bit of cake, and saw on
a shelf in his room about fifty or sixty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>cricket-balls, and various things which he
has collared when they went over. He
asked me a lot of questions about different
things, and I answered them. All he said
was about money. He also asked me to
be good enough to value the things he had,
which came over the wall from time to
time; and I did, and he thanked me. They
were worth fifteen shillings and tenpence;
and Wright’s ball, which everybody thought
was stolen by the milkman, wasn’t, for old
Grimbal’s got it; and the milkman should
be told and apologized to.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, he knew a lot about money, and
told me he had thousands of golden sovereigns,
which he makes breed into thousands
more.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>"‘You’re the only boy I ever met with
a grain of sense in his head. Now, if I
gave you a check on my bankers in Merivale
for five pounds to-day, and wrote to
you to-morrow morning to say I had changed
my mind, what would you do?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“I said, ‘It would be too late, sir, because
your check would have been sent off to my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>father that very night, to put out at interest
for me.’ He said, ‘That’s right. Never
give back money, or anything.’ Then he
asked me my name, and told me I might
come back to-morrow and look for my tooth
by daylight.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That was Gideon’s most peculiar adventure,
and, though he never found the tooth
or saw old Grimbal again, yet about seven
or eight months afterwards, when old Grimbal
was discovered all curiously twisted up
and dead in bed by the man who took him
his breakfast, the result of Gideon’s visit to
him came out. Old Grimbal had specially
put him into his will by some legal method,
and Doctor Dunston had Gideon into his
study three days after old Grimbal kicked.
It then was proved that old Grimbal had left
Gideon all the things that came over the
wall, and also a legacy of fifty pounds in
money, because, according to the bit of the
will which the Doctor read to Gideon out of
a lawyer’s letter, he was the only boy old
Grimbal had ever met with who showed any
intelligence above that of the anthropoid ape.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gideon returned all the balls and things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>to their owners free of charge, but not until
the rightful owners proved they were so.
And the money he sent to his father; and
his father, he told me afterwards, was so
jolly pleased about the whole affair that he
added nine hundred and fifty pounds to
old Grimbal’s fifty. Therefore, by shooting
Gideon’s front tooth at a robin, Slade was
actually putting the enormous sum of one
thousand pounds into Gideon’s pocket, which
I should think was about the rummest thing
that ever happened in the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gideon stopped at Dunston’s one term
after that. Then he went away, and, I believe,
began to help his father to sell diamonds.
He was fairly good at French, and
very at German; but of other things he
knew rather little, except arithmetic, and
his was the most beautiful arithmetic which
had ever been done at Merivale; for I heard
Stokes, who was a seventeenth wrangler in
his time, tell the Doctor so.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>The Chemistry Class</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This story about Guy Fawkes’s Night at
Dunston’s is worth knowing, because it
shows the rumminess of Nubby Tomkins.
Tomkins, I may say, was called “Nubby,”
owing to his nose, which was extremely
huge, though he said it was Roman, and
swore he wouldn’t change it if he could.
Anyway, Bradwell made a rhyme about it
that is certainly good enough to repeat.
He wrote it first on a black-board with
chalk, and a good many chaps learned it by
heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>It ran like this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Our Nubby’s nose is ponderous,</div>
      <div class='line'>And our Nubby’s nose is long;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So it wouldn’t disgrace</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Our Nubby’s face</div>
      <div class='line'>If half his nose was gone.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Which was not only jolly good poetry, but
also true--a thing all poetry isn’t by long
chalks, as you can see in Virgil and such
like.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, Nubbs sang the solos in chapel on
Sundays, and people came from far to hear
him do it; in consequence of which, so
Steggles said, the Doctor favored him, and
regarded him as an advertisement to Dunston’s.
But his singing wasn’t in it compared
with the advertisement he gave the
Doctor on Guy Fawkes’s Night the term before
Slade left.</p>

<p class='c000'>To explain the whole tremendous thing I
must tell you that Nubbs belonged to the
chemistry class. This class, in fact, was
pretty well started for him, his father telling
Dunston, so Nubbs said, that he shouldn’t
send him at all if he couldn’t be taught
chemistry; because Nubbs had shown a good
deal of keenness for chemicals generally
from the earliest days, and bought little
boxes of “serpents’ eggs” and red fire instead
of sweets ever since he was old enough
to buy anything. He had also blown off his
eyebrows and eyelashes with a mixture he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>was grinding up in a mortar, and they had
never grown again to this day--all of which
things showed he had chemistry in him to a
great extent. So the Doctor started a chemistry
class, and a chap called Stoddart, from
Merivale, came up once a week to take it;
and Nubbs joined, and so did I, not because
I had chemistry in me worth speaking of,
but because I was a chum of Nubby’s. Wilson
also joined, and so did Hodges. I may
mention my name is Mathers.</p>

<p class='c000'>I always thought that chemists simply
mix the muck doctors give you when you’re
queer, but it seems not. In fact, there are
several sorts of chemists, and Nubbs said he
hoped to belong to the best sort, who don’t
have bottles of red and green stuff in the
windows, and so on. He said a man who
sold pills and tooth-brushes, and liquorice-root
and soap, could not be considered a
classy chemist. The real flyers made discoveries
and froze air, and sneaked one another’s
inventions, and got knighted by the
Queen if they had luck and if they were
well thought of by the newspapers. I should
think really Nubbs might come to being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>knighted if he sticks to it, for even down to
the stuff in cough lozenges nothing is hid
from him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once the matron gave me simply a vile
lozenge for my throat, which got a bit foggy
owing to falling into the water during
“hare and hounds.” Well, the lozenge
was white in color, but even a white lozenge
may be very decent sometimes, so I
took a shot at it going to bed. But it was
so jolly frightful to the taste that I chucked
it away, and next morning found it again
and examined it after drying. On it I
then found the words “Chlorate of potash.”
So I took it to Nubbs. He said it was certainly
a chemical, and added that the stuff
in it was almost the same as you make
“Pharaoh’s serpents” with. I could hardly
believe such a thing, so he lighted the
lozenge and it burned blue, and a long, wriggling,
brownish ash came curling out of it
like a snake, just as Nubby said, which is
well worth knowing to anybody who ever
has a chlorate of potash lozenge. Many
such like remarkable and useful things
Nubby could tell you; among others, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>to mix sulphur and gunpowder and other
ingredients for fireworks. He had, in fact,
an awful fine book devoted to the subject,
and wooden affairs to load cases; and once
when Stoddart didn’t turn up and the
Doctor put us on our honor to do the
proper things in the laboratory alone, Nubbs
finished off analyzing some mess in about
five minutes, and spent the complete rest of
the time making a rocket. It had four blue
stars and thirteen yellow ones, and the case
was made out of a stiff brown paper roll in
which his mother had that morning sent
Nubbs a photograph of her new baby at
home. And Nubbs forgot the photograph
and stuffed the mixture in upon it, and made
a separate compartment for the stars on top.
So the photograph of Nubby’s mother’s new
baby, curiously enough, went off with the
rocket, and was never more seen by mortal
eye. Not that Nubbs cared. He kept the
rocket till the Doctor’s birthday, and after
prayers, when he knew he was in his study,
with the windows open and the blinds up,
being summer-time, Nubbs let it off in the
front garden, and we helped. It turned out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>very good in a way, though not quite a perfect
rocket, because instead of going up it
tore along the ground. But it tore for an
enormous distance, and then turned and
came back all of itself. And the blue stars
did not go off, but the yellow ones did--or
some--in a bed of rather swagger geraniums,
unfortunately.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Doctor didn’t care much about it,
not understanding our motives. But Nubbs
explained that he had done it out of honor
to the day. Then the Doctor thanked him,
and said he had doubtless meant well, and
that from the earliest times of the Chinese
the pyrotechnist’s art had been employed
upon occasions of legitimate festivity and
rejoicing.</p>

<p class='c000'>I mention this because it was the encouragement
he had over this creeping rocket
that made Nubbs get so above himself, if
you understand me. He never forgot it,
and next autumn term he actually asked
the Doctor if he might have a regular firework
display in the playground on the night
of the Fifth of November. He asked rather
cunningly, just after an English History
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>lesson, during which the Doctor had been
slating Guy Fawkes frightfully; and having
said such a heap of hard things about the
beggar, Doctor Dunston couldn’t very well
refuse.</p>

<p class='c000'>He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your request is unusual Tomkins; but
I can see no objection at the moment. However,
I will let you have my answer at no
distant date.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And I said to Nubbs:</p>

<p class='c000'>“That means he’ll think and think till
he’s got a reason why you shouldn’t, and let
you know then.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But Nubbs said to me:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe he’ll let me do it, feeling so
jolly bitter as he does about Guy Fawkes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And blessed if he didn’t! Nubbs undertook
to make the things himself. Nothing
was to be bought but chemicals in a raw,
unmixed condition, and Doctor Dunston
actually headed the subscription list with
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and Thompson gave the same, and
Mannering 2<i>s.</i>, and “Frenchy” 3<i>s.</i> Fifty-two
chaps also contributed various sums
from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>d.</i>; and Nubbs became rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>important, and went down gradually to the
bottom of the Lower Fifth owing to the
strain upon his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gathered together £2 7<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> in all,
and made it up to £2 10<i>s.</i> himself; and
Fowle’s father, who was in some business
where they used sulphur in terrific quantities,
got four pounds weight of it for nothing,
and Nubbs said it was a godsend for
illuminating purposes. He had been to the
Crystal Palace, and told us he was going to
carry everything out just like they did
there, as far as he could with the money.
At the last moment he got a tremendous
increase of funds in the shape of a pound
from his father; and, strangely enough, it
was that extra pound that wrecked him.
Without that father’s pound he couldn’t
have arranged the principal feature of the
whole performance; and without that principal
feature nothing in the way of misfortunes
to Nubbs worth mentioning would have
fallen out. But the pound came, and with
it a letter very encouraging to Nubby.</p>

<p class='c000'>He went on mixing away at the various
proper compounds and experimenting with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>them till he got his rockets to go up like
larks and his Roman candles to shoot out
stars the length of a cricket pitch. Then
his governor’s pound came, and he decided
on having a set piece with it. A set piece,
Nubby said, is the triumph of the firework
maker’s art--and very likely it is in proper
hands. You can have likenesses in fire, or
words, or ships, or “Fame crowning Virtue,”
or, in fact, pretty well anything. A set
piece is designed small first, then large;
and it is worked out with little tiny things
like squibs, only very small and without any
bang at the end. These are all lighted off
at once, and they burn one color first, then
change to another. Nubbs said his would
start yellow, because it was cheaper, and finally
turn green. The thing was what design
to have, and the four chaps in the
chemistry class all thought differently. I
advised trying a shot at a huge portrait of
the Doctor, but when it came to particulars
nobody knew how to work a portrait; and
Hodges thought we might do something
about Guy Fawkes, but Nubbs didn’t care
about that. Then Hodges thought again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and suggested the words, “God bless the
Doctor,” and I agreed that it would be fine;
but Wilson said it was profane, and might
annoy the Doctor frightfully, especially
when it turned green. Then Nubbs suggested
the words, “Doctor Dunston is a
Brick!” and Hodges said that it was good,
and Wilson said it might be good, but it
wasn’t true, anyway. However, it was three
to one, though we all admitted that, from
his point of view, Wilson was right to hate
the Doctor, because the Doctor hates him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The thing was to make a licking big
frame of light wood, and arrange the letters
across it, and the note of exclamation at the
end. This we did, and hammered it against
the playground wall, and wheeled up the
screens that go behind the bowler’s arm in
the cricket season, and hid away the set
piece behind them till the time came. Likewise
we arranged stakes for the Roman
candles, and a board for the Catharine
wheels, and a string for the flying pigeons,
and so on. And also we rigged up bits of
tin round the playground and by the fir-trees
at the top end and behind the gym.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>These were for Bengal lights and other illuminations.
All of this Nubbs had arranged
for the paltry sum of £3 10<i>s.</i> The
chemistry class had a half-holiday as the
time drew on, and we worked like niggers,
all four of us. Nubbs commanded, so to
speak, and mixed and did the grinding and
pounding and stars. Hodges and I hammered
up the heavy posts and stakes in the
playground, and carried out odd jobs generally;
and Wilson manufactured cases for
everything with brown paper and paste and
string.</p>

<p class='c000'>The set piece took two hundred and thirteen
little tubes. These Wilson made in
lengths of a yard and cut off at the required
size. And Nubbs stuffed them--with green
fire first and yellow on top. It promised to
be a jolly big thing altogether, and four days
before the night Nubbs began to get awfully
nervous, and to prepare yards and yards of
touch-paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Corkey minimus heard the Doctor
say to Browne:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Really the lads have devoted no little
energy and method on their proceedings;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>and it appears--so Mr. Stoddart tells me--that
the boy Tomkins has mixed his compounds
quite correctly, thereby insuring that
brilliance and variety which is looked for
in an exhibition of this kind. I wonder
whether we might ask the parents and
friends of those who dwell at Merivale and
the immediate neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Browne, who never misses a chance
of showing the brute he is at heart, said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Really, I should think twice, Doctor
Dunston. There is such an element of
chance with amateur fireworks. Unfortunately,
we can’t have a dress rehearsal, as
with the scenes from Shakespeare and the
recitations at the end of the term.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nevertheless,” said the Doctor, “I am
disposed to run the risk. A little harmless
pleasure combined with courtesy to relatives
at mid-term is rather desirable than not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So about fifty people were asked, and
they brought fifty more, and the cads from
Merivale got to know too, and there was
a good crowd of them along the fence by
the gym. Also two policemen came, and
Nubbs, who was nervous before, grew much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>worse when he heard of it. Besides, we
had a frightful shock two days before the
firework night, owing to the loss of poor
old Wilson. By simply sickening luck he
got reported by Browne for cheek. It was
when Browne came out in a new pair of
awfully squeaking boots with sham pearl
buttons at the side and drab tops; and
Wilson said they were ugly “eighteens” and
Browne heard him. The Doctor took an
awfully grave view of this, and told Wilson
that personality was the vilest kind of cheek.
Which wouldn’t have mattered, but he gave
him a thousand lines as well, and forbade
him to see the fireworks or help any more
with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And that’s the man you call a brick!”
Wilson said, rather bitterly. It certainly
was rough, after the way he had worked;
but from the Wing Dormitory, where he
would be at the time, he might be able to
see pretty well everything by leaning far out
between the window bars. Which Nubbs
pointed out to him, and he said he should.
He also said he’d pay out Browne some day,
and very likely Dunston too.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Well, the night came, and it was a fine
one; and the cads likewise came and lined
the fence. Then the Doctor clapped his
hands twice, which was the signal to begin;
and just as he did so out burst yellow fire
everywhere behind the bits of tin, lighted
simultaneously by seven chaps. And everybody
seemed to like it; and the Doctor
said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Capital! Bravo, Tomkins--a pleasing
and fairy like conceit!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Nubbs let fly two rockets, and they
went up well and burst out in stars, though
not as many by any means as we had
crammed into them; but one twisted for
some reason, and, instead of falling in the
direction of the cads, the stick twinkled
down, with just a spark of red here and
there in the line of it, bang behind the
chapel. Both Nubbs and I distinctly heard
it go smack through the top of the greenhouse,
and I rather think the Doctor heard
it too, for he didn’t say “Bravo” or anything,
but just sent a kid to tell Nubbs to
point future rockets the other way, which
disheartened Nubbs, because he’s like a girl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>at times of great excitement such as this
was. But he soon cheered up, especially at
the splendid success of the Catherine-wheels,
which he hadn’t hoped much from, and at
the cheers even the cads gave for the “golden
rain” which showed up everything as
bright as day, including Maude and the
other Dunston girls, and Mrs. Dunston, and
Nubby’s father standing smiling very amiably
by the Doctor, and the policemen blinking,
and the crowd, and a white dab hanging
out of a high window afar off, which I saw
and knew to be Wilson.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only the balloon failed, owing to the
nervousness of Nubbs, who set fire to the
whole show while he was trying to light the
spirit on the sponge underneath; but he
passed it off with crackers thrown among the
kids, and then, while they were all yelling,
he dragged away the cricket screens, and
Nubbs let off the set piece. He lighted the
touch-paper, and it snapped and crackled
all over the design in a moment, and a thick
smoke rose, and out of it came the set piece
flaring in rich yellow fire. Of course, we
expected what Nubbs and Wilson had arranged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>viz., “Doctor Dunston is a Brick!”
but instead there came out these awful
words:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='large'>“DOCTOR DUNSTON</span></div>
    <div><span class='large'>IS A BRUTE!”</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>That just shows what a frightful difference
three letters will make in a thing; and the
night was so dark and the letters so big that
you could have read them a mile off. Only,
if you will believe it, Dunston didn’t. People
applauded like anything at first, till the preliminary
smoke cleared off and they read
the truth. Then they shut up and made a
sound like wind coming through a wood.
But the cads yelled and roared, and so did
the policemen, for I heard them; and to
make the frightful thing a shade more
frightful, if possible, the Doctor, who is as
blind as ten bats, and didn’t realize the
end of the set piece, but only read his
name at the top, clapped his hands and
said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Famous, famous! You excel yourself,
Tomkins!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Then the words began gradually to turn
green; and, for that matter, so did Nubbs.
In fact, whether it was the reflected light
or the condition of his mind, or both, I
certainly never saw any chap become so perfectly
horrid to look at as Nubbs did then.
His nose seemed to stand out like a great
green rock, and his eyes bulged, and his
chin dropped, and the set piece turned his
teeth as bright as precious emeralds. He
just merely said, “Good Lord!”--nothing
more--then hooked it off into the darkness,
simply shattered.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same time Stoddart and Thompson,
and Mannering and Browne, and some
chaps from the Sixth, not knowing what
color the beastly set piece might turn next,
or how soon the Doctor would spot it,
dashed at the thing and dragged it down,
and trampled on it; and Browne in the
act burned the very boots that Wilson had
cheeked, which pleased Wilson a good deal
when he heard it.</p>

<p class='c000'>After that it was all over, and the Doctor,
thinking the set piece had died a natural
death, so to speak, saw me under the gas-light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>at the gate, as everybody streamed out,
and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, young man, what was that last word
in the illumination? I know you and
Hodges also had a hand in it, as well as
Tomkins.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And I said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Please, sir, we arranged the words ‘Doctor
Dunston is a Brick!’”</p>

<p class='c000'>And he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Excellent! Pithy and concise if a little
familiar. I only hope you all echo that
sentiment--every one of you. Send Tomkins
to me, and tell the other fellows there
is cake and lemonade going in the dining-hall.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just as if the other fellows didn’t know
it! But everybody gave three cheers for the
Doctor and Mrs. Dunston, and I started to
find Nubbs; and the policemen made the
cads go, though they went reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>I looked long for Nubby, and at last
found him all alone in the gym. One bit
of candle was burning, which looked frightfully
poor after all the brilliance of the fireworks,
and Nubbs had got the parallel bars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>under the flying rings, and was standing on
them--I mean the bars.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What the Dickens are you doing, Nubby?”
I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>And he answered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s no jolly good attempting to stop me
now, because it’s too late. My life is ruined,
and my father was there too to see it ruined;
and I’m going to hang myself, as every convenience
for hanging is here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mind you, he would have done it. Knowing
Tomkins as I do, and his great ingeniousness,
I don’t mind swearing that he
would have been a hung chap in another
minute. So I told him; but, though doubtful,
he decided to put it off, anyway. I even
got him to promise he wouldn’t hang himself
at all if his father believed his innocence
about the set piece. And Crewe, the head-master
under the Doctor, and old Briggs
and Thompson got us in a corner--Nubbs
and Hodges and me--and we solemnly vowed
we knew nothing of it; and Crewe went
down to the <cite>Merivale Trumpet</cite> and made the
reporter put in the original words when it
came out; and Thompson explained to Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Dunston how some evil-disposed, wicked person
had tampered with the set piece, and
begged her not to wound the feelings of the
Doctor by telling him; and the Sixth hushed
it up among the kids; and I sneaked a
bit of cake for Wilson, and went up after the
row was over and told him everything, down
to the burning of Browne’s boots.</p>

<p class='c000'>He confessed to me then that he had
done it, which didn’t surprise me much,
knowing how he had worked, and then at
the last minute almost been deprived of
seeing the show. It was certainly a terrible
revenge; but, of course, a terrible revenge
which doesn’t come off owing to a master
being too shortsighted to see it is pretty
sickening for the revenger. Besides the
risk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Crewe worked like a demon to find
out who had done it, and he suspected
Wilson from the first, but couldn’t prove it.
But at last he did find out through Fowle,
who got it out of Ferrars, who got it out
of West, who got it out of Nubbs in a
moment of rage. For I may say Wilson
himself told Nubbs, and Nubbs never forgave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>him, and says he never shall, even if
they ever both go to heaven.</p>

<p class='c000'>So Crewe, having found out, had some
talk with Wilson. But he didn’t lick him;
whereas Wilson did lick Fowle, and that
pretty badly. Not that Fowle cares for an
ordinary licking more than another chap
cares for a smack on the head. The only
way to hurt him is to twist his arm round,
about twice, and then hit him hard just
above the elbow. I may say I found this
out myself, and everybody does it now.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>Doctor Dunston’s Howler</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Mind you, if it’s interesting to watch
any ordinary person come a howler,
what must it be to see your own head-master
do it? A “howler,” of course, is the
same as a “cropper,” and you can come one
at cricket or football or in class or in everyday
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Dunston’s howler was a most complicated
sort, and I had the luck to be one of
the chaps who witnessed him come it. Of
course, to see any master make a tremendous
mistake is good; but when you are dealing
with a man almost totally bald and sixty-two
years of age the affair has a solemn side, especially
owing to his being a Rev. and a D.D.
In fact, Slade, who was with me, said the
spectacle reminded him of the depths of woe
beggars got into in Greek tragedies, which
often wanted half a dozen gods to lug them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>out of. But no gods troubled themselves
about Dunston; and it really was a bit awful
looked at from his point of view; because
it’s beastly to give yourself away to kids at
the best of times; and no doubt to him all
of us are more or less as kids, even the Sixth.</p>

<p class='c000'>He often had a way of bringing the parents
of a possible new boy through one or two of
the big class-rooms and the chapel of Merivale,
just to show what a swagger place it
was. Then we all bucked up like mad, and
the masters bucked up too, and gave their
gowns a hitch round and their mortar-boards
a cock up, and made more noise and put on
more side generally, just to add to the splendor
of the scene from the point of view of
the parents of the possible new boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes the affair was rather spoiled by
an aunt or mother or some woman or other
asking the Doctor homely sort of questions
about sanitary arrangements or prayers;
then to see old Dunston making long-winded
replies and getting even the drains
to sound majestic was fine. His manner
varied according to the people who came
over the school. Sometimes, if it only happened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>to be a guardian or a lawyer, he was
short and stern. Then he just swept along,
calling attention to the ventilation and discipline,
and looking at the chaps as if they
were dried specimens in a museum; but
with fathers or women he had a playful mood
and an expression known as the “parent-smile.”
To mothers he never talked about
“pupils,” but called the whole shoot of us
“his lads,” and beamed and fluttered his
gown, like a hen with chickens flutters its
wings. The masters always copied him, and
to see that little brute Browne trying to
flutter over the kids like a hen when the
Doctor came into his class-room was a ghastly
sight, knowing him as we did. Also the
Doctor would often pat a youngster on the
head and beam at him. He generally singled
Corkey minimus out for patting and beaming;
and Corkey minor said the irony of it
was pretty frightful, considering that Corkey
minimus, for different reasons, got licked
oftener by the Doctor than almost any chap
in the Lower School.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, one day in came the Doctor to the
school-room of the Fourth. I’m in the Sixth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>myself, and a personal chum of Slade’s, the
head of the school; but I happened to have
gone to the Fourth with a message, so I saw
what happened. A very big man who puffed
out his chest like a pigeon followed the
Doctor. He had a blue tie on with a jolly
bright diamond in it, and there were small
purple veins in a regular network over his
cheeks, and his mustache was yellowish-gray
and waxed out as sharp as pins. A lady followed
him with red rims to her little eyes
and gold things hanging about her chest.
The Doctor, being all arched up and rolled
round from the small of the back like a
wood-louse, seemed to show they were parents
of perhaps more fellows than one. The
big chap wore an eye-glass and spoke very
loud, and was jolly pleasant.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!” he said, “and this is where the
little boys work, eh? I expect, now, my
youngster will be drafted in among these
small men, Doctor Dunston?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is very possible--nay, probable in the
highest degree, my lord,” said the Doctor.
“We are now,” he continued, “in the presence
of the Fourth and Lower Fourth. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>class-room is spacious, as you see, and new.
A commanding panorama of the surrounding
country and our playing-fields may be
enjoyed from the French windows. If two
of you lads will move that black-board from
there, Lord Golightly may be able to see
something of the prospect.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Two of the kids promptly knocked down
the black-board nearly onto the purple-veined
lord’s head. Then suddenly the lady called
out and attracted his attention. Looking
round, we found she had got awfully excited,
and stood pointing straight at young Tomlin.
He was a mere kid, at the extreme
bottom of the Lower Fourth; but he happened
to be my fag, so I was interested. She
pointed at him, in the most frantic way, with
a hand in a browny-yellow glove, and a gold
bracelet outside the glove and a little watch
let into the bracelet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good gracious!” she said, “do look
Ralph! What an astounding resemblance!
Whoever is that boy?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Tomlin turned rather red in the gills,
which was natural.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know the lad?” asked the Doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“Never saw him before in my life; but
I hope he’ll forgive me for being so rude as
to point at him in that way,” she said.
“He’s exactly like our dear Carlo; they
might be twins.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Tomlin thought she meant a pet dog, and
got rather rum to look at.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Carlo is our son, you know,” explained
the lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Singular coincidence,” answered Doctor
Dunston, not looking very keen about it.
In fact, he wasn’t too fond of Tomlin at
any time, and seemed sorry he should be
dragged in now. But the kid was a very
tidy sort, really--Captain of the Third
Footer Eleven and a good runner. He happened
to be the son of a big London hatter
who had a shop of enormous dimensions in
Bond Street; and the Doctor was said to
get his own hats there; yet he didn’t like
Tomlin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tomlin went out into the open, and the
purple-veined lord shook hands with him,
and the lord’s wife stood him in the light
and turned him round to catch different expressions.
Then they admitted that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>likeness was really most wonderful, and
they both hoped Tomlin and Carlo would
be great friends. Tomlin, told by the Doctor
to answer, stood on one leg, twisted his
arms in a curious way he’s got when nervous,
and said he hoped they might be; but
he said it as though he knew jolly well they
wouldn’t.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the lord and the lady cleared out,
and a week later Carlo came. His real
name was Westonleigh, and he was a viscount
or something, being eldest son of an
earl; but we called him Carlo, and he grew
jolly waxy when he found his nickname had
got to Merivale before him. He fancied
himself to a most hideous extent for a kid
of nine, and explained he’d only come for a
year or so before going to Eton. He went
into the Lower Fourth, so Tomlin ceased to
be at the bottom of that class.</p>

<p class='c000'>The likeness between Carlo and my fag
was really most peculiar. It must have
been for Carlo’s own mother to see it; but
when Carlo heard that Tomlin would be a
hatter in the course of years he refused to
have anything to do with him. And Tomlin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>loathed Carlo, too, from the start; so instead
of being chums according to the wish
of the purple-veined lord, they hated one
another, and the first licking of any importance
which Carlo got he had from Tomlin.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chap was a failure all round, and it’s
no good saying he wasn’t. Everybody saw
it but Doctor Dunston, and he wouldn’t.
Carlo proved to be a sneak and a liar of the
deepest sort--not to masters, but to the
chaps; and he was also jolly cruel to animals,
and very much liked to torture things that
couldn’t hit him back, such as mice and insects.
He had a square face and snubby
nose, and a voice and eyes exactly similar to
Tomlin’s; but there was no likeness in their
characters, Tomlin being a very decent kid,
as I have said. Fellows barred Carlo all
round, and he only had one real chum in
the miserable shape of Fowle. Fowle sucked
up to him and listened for hours about his
ancestors, and buttered him at all times,
hoping, of course, that some day he would
get asked to Carlo’s father’s castle in the holidays.
I may also note Carlo never played
games, excepting tossing behind the gymnasium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>for half-pennies with Fowle and
Steggles, Steggles, of course, winning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Happening one day to go down through
the playground, young Tomlin saw Westonleigh
near a little fir-tree which grew at the
top of the drill-ground. He was alone, and
seemed to be doing something queer, so
Tomlin stopped and went over.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are you up to?” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frying ants,” said Carlo, “though it’s
no business of yours. You see, there’s turpentine
juice come out of this tree where I
cut it yesterday, and you can stick the ants
in it, then fry them to a cinder with a burning-glass,
like this.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s what you’re doing?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t you think you’re rather a little
beast?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What d’ you mean, hatter?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I mean I’m going to kick you for being
such a cruel beast.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They stood the same height to an inch
and were the same age, so it was a perfectly
sportsman-like thing for Tomlin to
offer.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“You seem to forget who you’re talking
to,” said Carlo.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, I don’t--no chance of that. Your
ancestors came over with William the Conqueror--carried
his portmanteau, I expect,
then cleared out when the fighting came on.
Yes, and another ancestor stabbed a friend
of Wat Tyler’s when he was face down on
the ground, after somebody else had knocked
him over. That’s what you are, ant-fryer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll thank you to let me pass,” said
Carlo. “I’m not accustomed to talking to
people like you, and if you think I’m going
to fight with a future hatter you’re wrong.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you can put your tail between
your legs and swallow this,” said Tomlin,
and he went on and licked Carlo pretty
well. He also broke his burning-glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll live to be sorry for this all your
life!” yelled out Carlo, when Tomlin let him
get up off some broken flower-pots on the
drill-ground. “I’ll never forget it; I’ll get
my father to make old Dunston expel you;
and when I’m a man I’ll devote all my time
to wrecking your vile hat business and ruining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>you and making you a shivering, starving
beggar in the streets!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go and sneak, I should,” said Tomlin.</p>

<p class='c000'>And blessed if Carlo didn’t! He tore
straight off to the Doctor just as he was,
in his licked condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>That much I heard from my fag, young
Tomlin, but the rest I saw for myself, as the
Sixth happened to be before the Doctor
in his study when Carlo arrived. He was
white and muddy, and slightly bloody and
panting; he looked jolly wicked, and his
collar had carried away from the stud, and
his trousers were torn behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My good lad, whatever has happened?”
began the Doctor. “Don’t say you have
met with an accident? And yet your appearance--”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing of the sort,” said Carlo, who
soon found out the Doctor had a weak place
for him, owing to his being a lord’s son.
“I’ve been frightfully and cruelly mangled
through no fault of my own; and I believe
some things inside me are broken too.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sit down, sit down, my unfortunate lad,”
said the Doctor. Then he rang the bell and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>told the butler to bring Viscount Westonleigh
a glass of wine at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s Tomlin done it,” said Carlo. “He
came up behind me, and, before I could defend
myself, he trampled on me and tried to
tear me limb from limb. I’m not strong,
and I may die of it. Anyway, he ought to
be expelled, and I’ll write to my father, the
earl, about it, and he’ll make the whole
country-side resound if Tomlin isn’t sent
away and his character ruined.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hush, Westonleigh!” said the Doctor.
“Have no fear that justice will not be done,
my boy. You shall yourself accuse Tomlin
and hear what he may have to say in defence.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Tomlin was sent for, and in about
ten minutes came.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is this true, boy Tomlin?” said the
Doctor, putting on his big manner. “One
glance at your victim,” he continued, “furnishes
a more conclusive reply to my question
than could any word of yours; nevertheless,
I desire to hear from your own lips
whether Viscount Westonleigh’s assertions
are true or not.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“Don’t know what he’s asserted, sir,” said
Tomlin, which was a smart thing for a kid
to say. “If he said I’ve licked him, it’s
true, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is what he <em>did</em> assert, sir, in words
chosen with greater regard for my feelings
than your own. And are you aware, George
Tomlin, that you have ‘licked’ one who, in
the ordinary course of nature, and subject to
the will of an all-just, all-seeing Providence,
will some day take his seat in the House of
Lords?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ve heard him <em>say</em> he will, sir,” answered
Tomlin, as though no statement of
Carlo’s could be worth believing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t answer in that offensive tone,
boy,” answered the Doctor, his voice rising
to the pitch that always went before a flogging.
“If your stagnant sense of right cannot
bring a blush to your cheek before the
spectacle of your scandalous achievement,
it will be necessary for me--for me, your
head-master, sir--to quicken the blood in
your veins and bring a blush to the baser
extremity of your person. Some learn
through the head, George Tomlin; some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>can only be approached through the hide;
and with the latter category you have long,
unhappily, chosen to throw in your lot.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Tomlin said nothing, but looked at Carlo.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Before proceeding, according to my
custom, I shall hear both sides of this
question--<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>audi alteram partem</em></span>, George
Tomlin. Now say what you have to say;
explain why your lamentable, your unholy,
your aboriginal passions led you to fall upon
Viscount Westonleigh from behind--to take
him in the rear, sir, after the unmanly
fashion of the North American Indian or
other primitive savage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I didn’t take him in the rear at all, sir,”
said Tomlin. “I stood right up to him, and
he said he wouldn’t fight a future hatter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A very proper decision, too, sir--a
natural and wise decision,” declared the
Doctor. “Why should the son of Lord Golightly
imbue his hand in the blood of--I
will not say a future hatter, for I yield to
no man in my respect for your father, Tomlin,
and his business is alike honorable
and necessary; but why should he fight
anybody?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“If he’s challenged he’s got to, sir, or
else take a licking.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No flippancy, sir!” thundered the Doctor
again. “Who are <em>you</em> to announce the
laws which govern the society of Merivale?
Shall it be possible in a Christian land, at
a Christian college for Christian lads, to find
infamous boys with tigrine instincts parading
the fold for the purpose of smiting when
and where they will? This, sir, is the very
apotheosis of savagery!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I didn’t do it for nothing, sir,” said
Tomlin. “I’m not going to sneak, of course;
but I--I licked Carlo for a jolly good reason,
and he knows what.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t know anything of the sort,” declared
Carlo. “You flew at me like a wolf
from behind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s a good one,” answered Tomlin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Anybody can see you did from the state
I’m in,” said Carlo.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You two boys,” began the Doctor again,
“though you know it not, stand here before
me as types of a great social movement, I
may even say upheaval. In the democratic
age upon which we are now entering, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>shall find the Tomlins at war with the Westonleighs;
we shall find the Westonleighs
disdaining to fight, and the Tomlins accordingly
doing what pleases them in their own
brutal way. Now, here I find myself met
with statement and counter-statement. The
indictment is all too clear against you, boy
Tomlin, for even the glass of old brown
sherry which he has just consumed fails to
soothe your unfortunate victim’s nerve-centres.
He is still far from calm; his
ganglions are yet vibrating. This work of
destruction was yours. You do not deny
it, but you refuse any explanation, making
instead a vague and ambiguous reference to
not sneaking. No man hates the tale-bearer
more than your head-master, sir, but there
are occasions when the school’s welfare and
the protection of our little commonwealth
make it absolutely necessary that offences
should be reported to the ruler of that commonwealth.
I have no hesitation in saying
that Westonleigh saw the present incident
in this light. He had no right to hush up
the matter. Whatever his private instincts
towards mercy, his duty to his companions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>and to me, together with a hereditary sense
of justice and the fearless instincts of his
race, compelled him to come before me and
report the presence of a young garroter in
our midst. I select the word, George Tomlin,
and I say that, having regard to the
perverted, not to say inverted, sense of justice
and honor all too common among every
community of boys, Westonleigh’s act was
a brave act. I accept his statement in its
entirety; consequently, Tomlin, you may
join me this evening, at nine o’clock, after
prayers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That meant a flogging, and Tomlin said,
“Yes, sir,” and hooked it; but the wretched
Carlo thought he was going to hear Tomlin
expelled. He burst out and said as much,
and the Doctor started as if a serpent had
stung him, and told Carlo to control the instinct
of revenge so common to all human
nature, and explained that chaps were not
expelled for trifles. He reminded Carlo that
Tomlin had an immortal soul like himself,
and seemed to imply that being expelled
from Merivale would ruin a chap’s future in
the next world as well as this one. Finally,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>he allowed Carlo, in consideration of the
dressing he had got, to stop in the playground
that afternoon with a book. So the
little skunk crept off, shattered ganglions
and all, pretending to walk lame; while the
Doctor, evidently much bothered altogether,
took up our work where he had left it.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c000'>Tomlin got flogged all right, and there
the matter ended, excepting that a lot of
fellows sent Carlo to Coventry and called
him “ant-fryer” from that day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, within three weeks, came the Doctor’s
howler, Steggles being responsible.
Steggles is a bit of a hound, but his cunning
is wonderful. As for the Doctor, he
continued making much of Carlo and sitting
on Tomlin, till one day, going into
chapel, he unexpectedly patted Tomlin on
the head. Tomlin was rather pleased, because
he thought the Doctor was relenting
to him; but when Steggles heard of it he
said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, you fool, he thought he was patting
Westonleigh!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, on an evening when Tomlin was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>cooking a sausage for me in the Sixth’s
class-room, he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Please, I should like to speak to you, if
I may.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So I chucked work, and told him to say
what he liked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s only to show how things go against
a chap, no matter what he does,” said the
kid. “This term I have been flogged for
licking Carlo, and caned three times since
for other things, which were more bad luck
than anything else; and now I’ll be flogged
again to-morrow for absolute certain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, it’s a jolly muddle. You know
Steggles?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, you’re a fool to go about with him,”
I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps I was. Anyway, Steggles and
me made a plot to get some of the medlars
from the tree on the lawn, and we minched
out after dark to do it. They’re simply allowed
to fall and rot on the ground, which
is a waste of good tuck, Steggles says. We
went out about ten o’clock last night, past
Browne’s study window; and we looked in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>from the shrubbery to see the window open,
and soda-water and whiskey and pipes on
the table; but no Browne, strange to say.
Then we sneaked on, and Steggles suddenly
heard something and got funky, but I kept
him going. We reached the tree and Steggles
lighted his bull’s-eye lantern, so as
to collect the medlars, when suddenly out
from behind the tree itself rushed a man.
We hooked it like lightning, naturally, and
I never saw Steggles go at such a pace in
my life, and he stuck to his lantern, too;
but I tripped and fell, and before I could
get up the man had collared me. If you’ll
believe it, the man was Browne! He asked
me who the other chap was, and I said I
couldn’t be quite sure; so he told me to
go back to bed, which I did. That was
last night; and the one medlar we had time
to get Steggles had eaten before I got back,
which shows what Steggles is. To-day
Browne will tell the Doctor. He always
chooses the evening after prayers, so that
he can work the Doctor up with his stories
and get a chap flogged right away; because
it often happens when Doctor Dunston
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>says he’ll flog a chap next day he doesn’t
do it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And what is Steggles going to do?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He says he is watching events. He
also says that Browne was certainly stealing
the Doctor’s medlars himself, and really we
surprised him, not he us; but, of course,
Steggles says it’s no good my telling the
Doctor that. Steggles also says that he’s
got an idea which may come to something.
I don’t know; but he’s a very cute chap.
I’ve got to keep out of the way after prayers
to-night, and Steggles is going to watch
Browne. He won’t tell me his plan. I
thought once that perhaps he meant giving
himself up for me, and I asked him, and he
said I ought to know him better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Tomlin then cleared out, and as the
Doctor took Slade and me for a short Greek
lesson every evening after prayers, because of
special examinations, I had the good luck to
see the end of the business that very night.</p>

<p class='c000'>We’d just got to work by the Doctor’s
green-shaded reading-lamp when Browne
came in with his grovelling way, pretending
he was awfully sorry for having to round on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Tomlin, but that his duty gave him no
option, and so on.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Last night,” he said, “I was sitting correcting
exercises in my study when I fancied
I saw a form steal across the grass outside.
Thinking some vagabond might be in the
grounds, I dashed out and followed as quickly
as possible. Presently I saw a light, and
noted two figures under the medlar-tree.
Fearing they might be plotting against the
house, I went straight at them, and, to my
astonishment, saw that they were only boys.
One darted away, and I failed to catch him;
the other, I much regret to say, was Tomlin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That is how Browne put the affair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tomlin again!” exclaimed the Doctor.
“Positively that boy’s behavior passes the
bounds of endurance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, taking the medlars of one who has
always treated him as you have. I couldn’t
trust myself to speak to him. He’s a very
disappointing boy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He’s a disgraceful, degenerate, disreputable
boy! I can forgive much; but the
stealing of fruit--and that <em>my</em> fruit! Greediness,
immorality, ingratitude in the person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>of one outrageous lad! I thank you, Browne.
Yours was a zealous act, and argued courage
of high order. Oblige me by sending Tomlin
hither at once. There shall be no delay.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Browne hurried off to find the wretched
Tomlin; and Doctor Dunston, who always
had to work up his feelings before flogging
a chap, snorted like a horse, and took off his
glasses, and went to the corner behind the
book-case where canes and things were kept.
He seemed to forget Slade and me, so we
sat tight in the gloom outside the radius of
light thrown by the green-shaded lamp, and
waited with regret to see Tomlin catch it.
The Doctor talked to himself as he brought
out a birch and swished it through the air
once or twice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Upon my soul,” he said, “Lord Golightly’s
son was right. His knowledge of
character is remarkable in so young a lad.
Tomlin will have to be expelled; Tomlin
must go; such consistent, such inherent depravity
appears ineradicable. Pruning is of
no avail; the branch must be sacrificed. My
medlars under cover of darkness! And I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>would have given them freely had he but
asked!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He evidently wasn’t going to expel Tomlin
this time, but he meant doing all he
knew with the birch; and as Tomlin was
some while coming, the Doctor’s safety-valves
were regularly humming before he
turned up. When he did come he walked
boldly in; and the Doctor, who had been
striding up and down like a lion at the Zoo,
didn’t wait for any remarks, but just went
straight for him, seized him by the nape of
the neck, nipped his hand round his back--in
a way he did very neatly from long practice--and
began to administer about the hottest
flogging he’d given to any boy in his
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So--you--add--the--eighth--com--mand--ment--to--the--others--you--have--already--shattered--deplorable--boy!”
roared the Doctor, giving Tomlin one between
each smack. “You--would--purloin--steal--rob--the
medlars--of your preceptor.
You would lead others--to--share--your--sin.
You would bring--tears--of--grief--to--a--good--mother’s--eyes!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Here the Doctor stopped a moment for
breath, but he still held on to Tomlin, who,
much to my surprise, wriggled about a good
deal. In fact, he shot out his legs over and
over again at intervals, like a grasshopper
does when it gets into the water; and when
he got a chance he yelled back at the Doctor:</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a lie--a filthy lie!” he shrieked out.
“Beast--devil! Let me go! Let me go!
I never touched your rotten old medlars--oh!--oh!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the Doctor went off again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Silence, miserable child! Cease your
blasphemies. Falsehood--will--not--save--you--now!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never touched them, I tell you, you
muddle-headed old beast! You’re killing
me, and my father’ll imprison you for life
for it. I wish they could hang you. I’ll
make you smart for this if you only live till
I grow up--devil!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Doctor had shot his bolt. He
gave Tomlin a final smack, then shook him
off like a spider, picked up his mortar-board,
which had fallen off in the struggle, and put
the birch in its place.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“Now go, and don’t speak another word,
or I shall expel you, wretched lad!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Meantime Slade and I were fairly on the
gasp, for from the time that Tomlin, as we
thought, had called the Doctor a devil we
realized the truth. Now his passion nearly
choked him; he danced with pain and rage;
only when the Doctor took a stride towards
him he opened the door and hooked it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Doctor puffed and grunted like a
traction-engine trying to get up a hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>“These are the black days in a head-master’s
life, Slade,” he said. “That misguided
lad thinks that I enjoyed administering his
punishment, yet both mentally and physically
the operation caused me far greater suffering
than it brought to him. I am wounded--wounded
to the heart--and the exertion
causes and will cause me much discomfort
for hours to come, owing to its unusual
severity. I may say that not for ten years
has it been necessary for me to flog a boy as
I have just flogged George Tomlin. Now
let us proceed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I couldn’t have broken it to him, but
Slade did. He said:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Please, sir, it wasn’t Tomlin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not Tomlin--not Tomlin! What d’ you
mean, boy? Who was it, then?” said the
Doctor, his eyebrows going up on to his forehead,
which was all quite dewy from the
hard work.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was young Carlo--I mean Westonleigh,”
said Slade.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Viscount Westonleigh!” gasped the
Doctor, his mouth dropping right open in
a very rum way by itself, if you understand
me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then why in the name of Heaven didn’t
you say so? How <em>dare</em> you stand there and
watch me commit an offence against law and
justice? How did you dare to watch me
ignorantly torture an innocent boy, and that
boy-- Go! go both of you--you, Slade, and
you, Butler, also. Go instantly, and send
Browne and Viscount Westonleigh to me.
Good God! this is terrible--terrible!”</p>

<p class='c000'>So that was his howler, and to see him in
his chair looking so old and haggard and
queer was rather frightful. He seemed
suddenly struck with limpness, and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>hands shook like anything, and so did his
bald head; and he puffed as if he’d been
running miles; and Slade said afterwards
that he looked jolly frightened too. He put
his face in his hands as we went out, and we
heard him say something about Lord Golightly
and ruin, and universal opprobrium
on his gray hairs, though really he had none
worth mentioning; and Slade said he almost
thought the Doctor was actually going to
cry, if such a thing could be possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>We sent Browne off to him, but Carlo
wasn’t to be found. He’d been seen yelling
somewhere, but couldn’t be traced. What
had happened was this: Tomlin, in obedience
to Steggles, had kept rather close after
prayers; in fact, he had spent the half-hour
to bed-time in a cupboard in the <a id='corr198.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='gymnasium.'>gymnasium,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_198.18'><ins class='correction' title='gymnasium.'>gymnasium,</ins></a></span>
under the rubber shoes. So Browne, not
finding him, had told the first boy he saw
to do so; and that boy happened to be
Steggles, who had been at his heels ever
since he went to the Doctor. Steggles is
a miserable, unwholesome thing, but his
strategy certainly comes off. Once having
the message, all was easy, because Steggles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>merely found Carlo, and told him the Doctor
wanted him. The result was much better
than even Steggles hoped; because, though
the Doctor generally fell on a chap who
came to be flogged straightaway, like he did
on Carlo, it wasn’t often anybody got such
a frightful strong dose as Carlo had. Afterwards,
when taxed, Steggles swore, of course,
that he thought he was talking to Tomlin.
Seeing the likeness, this might have been
perfectly true, though in their secret hearts
everybody knew Steggles too jolly well to
really believe it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Carlo didn’t turn up, and after an hour
or more of frantic rushing about, somebody
said perhaps he’d jumped down the garden
well owing to the indignity of what he’d
got. But soon afterwards, in reply to a
special telegram sent for the Doctor by the
people at the railway station, an answer
came from Golightly Towers, twenty miles
off, where the purple-veined lord, father of
Carlo, hung out. The kid, it seemed, had
sloped down to Merivale railway station after
his licking, and taken a ticket right away for
Golightly, and gone home by the last train
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>but one that night. He never returned
either, but next day his father dropped in
on Doctor Dunston, and Fowle managed to
hear a little of what went on through the
key-hole. He said that as far as he could
make out the lord didn’t think much of the
matter, and said one thrashing more or less
wouldn’t mar Carlo. But the lord’s wife,
who didn’t come, evidently took the same
view as Carlo, for he never returned to
Dunston’s again. The Doctor’s howler ended
in his losing the little bounder altogether,
which, with his views about lords in general,
and especially earls, must have been frightfully
rough on him.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to Tomlin, actually the Doctor never
flogged him after all! I think his spirit had
got a bit broken, and though Tomlin went
at the end of the term, he wasn’t expelled,
but withdrawn by mutual consent, like you
hear of things in Parliament sometimes.
He wouldn’t have gone at all, but he refused
to say who was under the medlar-tree
with him, and stuck to it; and Steggles
absolutely declined to give himself up,
because, as he truly said, he had more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>kept his promise to Tomlin about helping
him out of the mess.</p>

<p class='c000'>So Tomlin went. He was a very decent
little chap indeed, and nearly all the fellows
at Dunston’s promised faithfully to buy their
hats entirely at his place in Bond Street,
London, when they left school; which will
be very good business for him if they do.
As for the Doctor, it’s a peculiar fact that
for a whole term after Carlo’s affair he never
flogged a single <a id='corr201.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='chap,'>chap.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_201.10'><ins class='correction' title='chap,'>chap.</ins></a></span> He didn’t seem to
have any heart in him, somehow, owing to
the rum way the howler told upon his spirit.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>Morrant’s Half-Sov.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Of course, as Steggles said truly, the rummest
thing about the whole story of Morrant’s
half-sov. was that he should have one.
Morrant, in fact, never got any pocket-money
in his life, owing to his father being a gentleman
farmer. Not that he had nothing. On
the contrary, his hampers were certainly the
best, except Fowle’s, that ever came to Dunston’s,
both for variety and size and fruit.
The farming business, Morrant said, was all
right from his point of view in the holidays,
as the ferreting, both rats and rabbits, was
good enough for anything, and three packs
of hounds met within walking distance of his
farm, one pack being harriers, which Morrant,
by knowing the country well, could run with
to a certain extent while they hunted. But
Morrant’s father was so worried about chemical
manures and other farming things, including
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the price of wheat, that he didn’t see
his way to giving Morrant any pocket-money.
He explained to Morrant once that he was
putting every halfpenny he could spare into
Morrant’s education, so as to save him from
having to become a gentleman farmer too
when he grew up.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Morrant didn’t get a farthing in a
general way; so when there arrived a hamper
with an envelope in it, and in the envelope
a bit of paper, and in the paper a half-sovereign,
Morrant was naturally extremely
surprised and also pleased. It came from
his godfather, who had never taken any notice
of Morrant for thirteen years, though he
was a clergyman. But the previous term Morrant
had got a prize for Scripture history,
and when that came to his godfather’s ears,
through Morrant’s mother mentioning it in
a letter, he wrote and said it was good news,
and very unexpected. So he sent the money;
and really Morrant was quite bewildered with
it, being so utterly unaccustomed to tin even
in the meanest shape.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had a friend by the name of Ferrars,
who was much more religious than Morrant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>himself, and knew even more Scripture history;
and as a first go-off he asked Ferrars
what he ought to do with the money. And
Ferrars said that before everything Morrant
ought to give a tithe to charity. But when
it was explained to Morrant that this meant
chucking away a shilling on the poor, he
didn’t take to the idea an atom. He said
his father had set him against giving tithes,
not believing in them very much.</p>

<p class='c000'>So Morrant went to Gideon, who knew
much more about money than Ferrars, and
he said on no account to give a penny away
in charity, because Morrant wasn’t up in the
subject, and might do more harm than good.
He also said that in the case of a chap who
had never had a half-sovereign in his life
before, it was a great question whether he
could be expected to give away any; and
Morrant said there was no question about it
at all, because he wasn’t going to. And it
made even a difference in his feeling towards
Ferrars, for, as he very truly said, a chap
who advised him like Ferrars had couldn’t
be much of a friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having decided to keep it, the point was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>what to do with it. The novelty of the
thing staggered him, and, knowing he would
probably never have another half-sovereign
till he grew up, Morrant felt the awful importance
of spending it right, because an
affair once bought could never be replaced
if lost. And, as Bray said, “If you get used
to a thing, like a watch-chain or a tie-ring,
and then lose it, the feeling you get is much
worse than if you had never had it at all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I thought about it too for Morrant, as he
once sent me a brace of rabbits by post, shot
by himself in the holidays. I pointed out
to him that half a sovereign was a most
difficult sum really, being, as it were, not
small and not exactly huge, and yet too
much to make light of, especially in Morrant’s
case. If he had got a sovereign, for
instance, he might have bought a silver
watch-chain to take the place of one which
he had. It was made of the hair of his
grandmother when she was young, and Morrant
didn’t much like it, and had often tried
to sell it and failed. But ten bob wouldn’t
buy a silver chain worth having. Morrant
had an idea about braces, and of course he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>might have bought such braces for the
money as would have been seldom seen and
very remarkable; but braces are a poor
thing to put good money into, and I dissuaded
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>There came a change in Morrant after he
had had the half-sovereign for four days and
not thought of anything to buy. He began
to worry, because time was going on and
nothing being done. Fellows gave him
many ideas, some of which he took for an
hour or two, but always abandoned after a
while. Murray told him of a wonderful box
of new conjuring tricks which was to be
had, and he nearly bought it, but luckily
remembered just in time that the new tricks
would get old after a while, and some might
be guessed and would become useless. Then
Parkinson had a remarkably swagger paint-box,
and knew where Morrant could get another
with only three paints less for ten
shillings. And Morrant as near as a toucher
bought that, but happened to remember he
couldn’t paint, and didn’t care in the least
about trying to. Corkey minimus said he
would run the risk and sell Corkey minor’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>bat to Morrant for ten bob, the bat having
cost twelve. The bat was spliced and Corkey
minor was in Australia, having, luckily for
him, sailed to sea just before an exam., owing
to a weak lung. If Morrant had played
cricket he would certainly have bought the
bat; but there again, even though Gideon
told him he might easily get ten-and-six or
eleven shillings for the bat next term, he
hesitated, and finally Gideon bought the bat
himself--as an investment, he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, there was Morrant stuck with his
tin. He wouldn’t even change it, because
Gideon warned him against that, and told
him his father knew men who had made
large fortunes simply by not changing gold
when they had it. Gideon said there was
nothing like never changing gold; so Morrant
didn’t, only of course there was no good
in keeping the money specially stitched into
a private and unknown part of his trousers,
as he did, for safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>That half-sovereign acted like a regular
cloud on Morrant’s mind; and then came an
extraordinary day when it acted more like a
cloud than ever, owing to its disappearing.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Morrant had sewn it, with a needle and
thread borrowed from the housekeeper, into
a spot at the bottom of his left trouser-pocket,
and from this spot it mysteriously
vanished in the space of two hours and a
half. He had changed in the dormitory for
“footer,” and left his trousers on his bed at
three o’clock, returning to them at 4.45.
Then, naturally feeling for his half-sovereign,
he missed it altogether, and when
he examined the spot he found his money
had been cut out of the bottom of the pocket
with a knife.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very wisely Morrant, seeing what a tremendous
thing had happened, did not make
a lot of row, but just told about ten chaps
and no more. I was one. My name is Newnes.
I said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The first question is, Who knew your
secret hiding-place?” and Butler said it was
a very good question and showed sense in
me. Butler is, of course, high in the Sixth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Morrant, on thinking it over, decided that
three chaps, or four at the outside, knew his
hiding-place. They were Ferrars, Gideon,
Fowle, and, Morrant thought, Phipps. So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>first Butler, who very kindly undertook the
affair for Morrant, had Phipps brought up.
Phipps stammers even when most calm and
collected, and, being sent for by Butler,
caused him so much excitement that Butler
made him write down the answers to his
questions, and even then Phipps lost his
nerve so that he spelled “yes” with two s’s.
But he solemnly put down and signed that
Morrant had never told him where he kept
his half-sovereign; and after he had gone
Morrant said that, now he came to think
about it, he felt sure Phipps was right.
Which reduced the matter to Ferrars, Gideon,
and Fowle; and the first two were set
aside by Morrant because Ferrars was, of
course, his personal friend, despite the passing
coldness about Ferrars’ advice, and Gideon,
though very keen about money and a
great judge of it, was known to be absolutely
straight, and had never so much as choused
a kid out of a marble.</p>

<p class='c000'>Butler said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“That leaves Fowle; and if you told
Fowle you were a little fool.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Morrant said:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“We were both Roman Catholics by religion,
and that makes a great tie; and
though many chaps hate Fowle pretty
frightfully, I’ve never known him try to
score off me, except once, when he failed
and apologized.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Butler said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s all right, I dare say; but he’s a
little beast and a cur, and also a sneak of the
deadliest dye. I don’t say he’s taken the
money, because that’s a libel, and he might,
I believe, go to law against me; but I do
say that only one out of three people could
have taken it, and we know two didn’t,
therefore Q.E.D. the other must have.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Morrant didn’t follow this very clever
reasoning on the part of Butler. He only
thought that Fowle, being a Roman Catholic,
would never rob another; and Butler
said he would, because it wasn’t like Freemasons,
who wouldn’t score off one another
for the world. He explained that history
was simply choked up with examples of Roman
Catholics scoring off one another.</p>

<p class='c000'>Butler said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Religion’s quite different. One Buddhist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>is often known to have done another Buddhist
in the eye, so why shouldn’t one Roman do
another? In fact, they have thousands of
times, as you’ll know when you come to
read a little history and hear about the
Spanish Inquisition. Especially this may
have happened seeing that Fowle is the chap.
I tell you candidly that, in my opinion, after
a good deal of experience of fellows in general,
I take Fowle to be the most likely boy
in Merivale to have done it; and knowing
him to have had the secret of the private
pocket reduces it to a certainty in my mind.
Tax him with it suddenly in the night, and
you’ll see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Morrant slept in the same dormitory with
Fowle, and that night the whole room was
woke up at some very late hour by the sound
of Morrant taxing Fowle. Fowle took a long
time to realize what was being said, and when
he was awake enough to realize what Morrant
was getting at, he showed tremendous
indignation, and asked what he had ever done
that such a charge should be brought against
him, especially at such a time. He reminded
Morrant that they were of the same way of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>thinking in holy affairs, and said he was extremely
sick with Morrant, and thought Morrant’s
religion must be pretty rocky if it
allowed him to wake a chap up in the night
and charge him with such a crime. In fact,
Fowle went on so that Morrant finally apologized
rather humbly.</p>

<p class='c000'>From that day forward began the extraordinary
disappearance of coin in general at
Dunston’s. Shillings constantly went, and
also half-crowns. Gideon got very excited
about it, and said watches must be kept and
traps set. There was evidently a big robbery
going on, and Gideon said if the chaps
weren’t smart enough to catch the thief
they deserved to lose their tin. Certainly
he never lost a penny himself. But, despite
tremendous precautions, money kept going
in small sums. Ferrars was set to watch in
the pavilion, I remember, during a football
match, and Morrant himself, and even Butler
once or twice, also watched. Some chaps
thought it was the ground-man; but as
money also disappeared at school, that showed
it couldn’t be him. And then there was a
theory that it might be a charwoman who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>came from Merivale twice a week. I believe
she was a very good charwoman of her kind,
and Ferrars, who is great about helping the
poor and so on, told me she was a very deserving
woman with a husband at home who
drank, and children too numerous to mention.
Which Gideon remembered against
the charwoman when the money began
to go, and it turned his suspicion towards
her, because, as he said, with the state of
her home affairs, money must be a great
temptation. So a watch was set on her, and
a curious thing happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being small, I can get into a boot cupboard
very easily, and I can also breathe
anywhere through a hole bored with a
gimlet. This was done to the door of the
boot cupboard, and two other rather larger
holes were also made for my eyes. Mrs.
Gouger, which was the charwoman’s name,
had to do a lot of work in this room--a
large one leading out of the gym. And
there, on a certain half-holiday, I was watching
her.</p>

<p class='c000'>She worked jolly hard as far as I could
say, and made a good deal of dust, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>curious noise through her teeth when she
scrubbed, which I thought only men did
when they washed horses; but there was
nothing suspicious, if you understand me.
She didn’t touch a coat or anything, though
many were hanging against a wall; and the
few caps about she merely picked up and
hung on the pegs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, just before she finished, who should
come in but Ferrars, and, to my great
astonishment, Mrs. Gouger courtesied to him
as though he had been the housekeeper or
the Doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ferrars treated her with great loftiness, and
evidently knew all about her private affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“And how is the child that’s got mumps?”
and she said it was better. He then gave
her some advice about her husband, which
I didn’t hear, and she blessed him for all
his goodness to her, and said God had sent
him to a lone, struggling woman, and that
he would reap a thousandfold what he had
sown. All of which, coming from Mrs.
Gouger to Ferrars, seemed very curious to
me. Presently he said:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“Well, I cannot stop longer. I’m glad
the child is better. Keep on at your husband
about the pledge; and here’s a shilling.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Mrs. Gouger put the shilling in her
pocket and blessed him again. And Ferrars
went.</p>

<p class='c000'>That very day young Forrest lost a shilling
out of his desk, which doesn’t lock,
owing to Forrest having taken the lock off
to sell to Meadowes last term.</p>

<p class='c000'>I told Butler and Gideon what I had
seen, and Butler thought it rum, and
Gideon said there was more in it than met
the eye.</p>

<p class='c000'>Butler said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Evidently the kid” (Ferrars is a kid
from Butler’s point of view) “has given the
charwoman tin before, or else she wouldn’t
have blessed him. Now the question is,
How much pocket-money does Ferrars
get?”</p>

<p class='c000'>And I said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“A shilling a week.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“When does he get it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mondays.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Butler said, “Ah!” but nothing seemed
to strike him, and Gideon thought that Mrs.
Gouger ought to be spoken to. This Gideon
undertook to do; and the next week he did.
What happened was that Mrs. Gouger said
all that she had before said to Ferrars about
her husband and children, but added that
a young gentleman with a most Christian
heart had lately interested himself in her
misfortunes. Gideon asked if it was a
Dunston chap, and Mrs. Gouger answered
that she was not at liberty to say. She seemed
rather defiant about it, Gideon thought,
and, in fact, when he pressed her for the
amount the chap gave her, she told Gideon
to mind his own business. A watch was
still kept, especially on Ferrars; and once
Butler did an awfully cunning thing by setting
Ferrars to watch and setting another
chap to watch Ferrars, if you follow what I
mean. The other chap was Butler himself,
and the room was a dormitory. But it came
out rather awkwardly for Butler, because he
sneezed at the very start, and Ferrars got
out from under the bed where he had arranged
to watch, and found Butler watching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>behind a coat against the wall. Then they
had a row, because Ferrars evidently thought
Butler was there to watch him; which he
was.</p>

<p class='c000'>The end of the affair came out rather
tame in its way, and only shows what awfully
peculiar ideas some chaps have. Gideon
finally spoke to Slade, the head of the school,
and though Slade doesn’t like Gideon, owing
to his way of making money by usury, yet it
was such a serious affair that he listened all
through and promised to go to the Doctor.
Gideon had actually kept an account of all
the money stolen, and it amounted now to
the tremendous sum of four pounds five shillings
and sixpence, including Morrant’s half-sovereign.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, after Dr. Dunston knew, we heard
one day from Fowle that he had sent for
Mrs. Gouger to his study, and that she had
been there fully half an hour and come out
crying. Fowle had listened as best he could
till the Doctor’s butler had come by and told
him to hook it; but he had heard nothing
except one remark in the voice of Mrs.
Gouger, and that remark was, “Four pound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>five and sixpence, sir, and a godsend if ever
money was.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gideon said her mentioning of the exact
sum was a very ominous thing for Ferrars.
And what was more ominous still happened
that evening, for Ferrars wasn’t at prep. or
prayers.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were a number of ideas about as to
what it all meant, and Corkey minimus, who
always tries to get among chaps bigger than
himself and say clever things, came out with
a theory that Mrs. Gouger was Ferrars’s
mother, and that Ferrars was therefore
stealing and making the money over to her.
But Butler merely smacked his head when
he heard it, and told Corkey minimus not to
be a little ass.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gideon was the only chap who hadn’t any
idea. He knew Ferrars’s great notions about
helping the poor and giving tithes to parsons,
and so on, but he said for a chap to steal
money and hand it over to a charwoman in
charity was contrary to human nature. All
the same, if a thing actually happens, it can’t
be contrary to human nature. Anyway, after
prayers next morning the Doctor stopped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>the school in chapel and explained everything.</p>

<p class='c000'>He said:</p>

<p class='c000'>"My boys, while it is true that you come
to Merivale to be instructed by me and
those who labor here among you on my
behalf, it is also true that I learn occasionally
from those whom I teach. Indeed, new
problems are almost as often set by you
for my solution as by me for yours, and
seldom has a more intricate difficulty confronted
me than that which yesterday challenged
my attention. There has recently
happened among us a mysterious disappearance
of coins of the realm. Now
a shilling, a sixpence, a penny-piece, if
deposited in one spot, will usually remain
there until removed by human agency. And
the human agent who removes money which
belongs to another without that other’s
sanction is a thief. Boys, briefly there has
been a thief among you--a thief whose
moral obliquity has taken such an extraordinary
turn, whose views of rectitude have
become so distorted, that even my own experience
of school-boy ethics cannot parallel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>his performance. This lad has looked
around him upon the world, and found in
it, as we all must find, a vast amount of
suffering and privation, of honest toil and
of humble heroism, displayed by the lowest
among us. He has also observed that
Providence is pleased to make wide distinctions
between the rich and the poor; he has
noted that where one labors for daily bread
another reaps golden harvests without the
trouble of putting in the sickle. This extraordinary
boy contrasted the position of
one of these humble workers with that of
those among whom his own lot was thrown
here, and he found that whereas that obscure
but necessary and excellent person,
Mrs. Gouger, she whose duty it is to cleanse,
scour, and otherwise purify the disorder
produced by our assemblies--he found, I
say, that whereas Mrs. Gouger worked extremely
hard for sums not considerable, albeit
handsome in connection with the nature
of her labors, others of the human family--yourselves--were
in receipt of weekly allowances
of varying amounts for which you
toiled not, neither did you spin.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“This unhappy lad allowed his mind to
brood on the apparent injustice of such an
arrangement, and instead of coming to his
head-master for an explanation of this and
other problems which arose to puzzle his
immature intelligence, permitted himself
the immoral, the scandalous, the disgraceful
and horribly mistaken course of righting the
balance from his point of view. This could
only be effected by defiance of those divine
laws which govern all properly constituted
bodies of human society. Ferrars--I need
not conceal his name any longer--Ferrars
broke one commandment in order to obey
another. His fatuous argument, as it was
elaborated yesterday to me, stands based on
error; his crime was the result of the most
complicated ignorance and vicious sophism
it has ever been my lot to discover in a boy
of twelve. He did evil that good might
come. Ascertaining from the inspired Word
that ’charity covereth a multitude of sins,’
he imagined it must extend to cover that
forbidden by the Eighth Commandment.
This commandment he broke no less than
fourteen times. You ask with horror why.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>That the domestic affairs of Mrs. Gouger
might be ameliorated. He took the pocket-money
of his colleagues, and with it modified
those straits into which poverty and conjugal
difficulties have long cast Mrs. Gouger. It
was Ferrars’s unhappy, and I may say unparalleled,
design to go on appropriating the
money of his school-mates until a sum of five
pounds had been raised and conveyed to
Mrs. Gouger. Of this total, with deplorable
ingenuity, he had already subtracted from
various pockets the sum of four pounds five
shillings and sixpence; it was his intention
to continue these depredations until the entire
sum had been collected. But the end
has come. The facts have been placed before
me, and I confess to you that perhaps
never have I been confronted with a problem
more peculiar. After a lengthy conversation
with those who support me here, and after
placing the proposition before a higher tribunal
than any which earth has to offer, I
have come to a curious decision. I have determined
to leave the fate of the boy Ferrars
in your hands. This time to-morrow I shall
expect Slade, as representing the school, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>inform me of your decision, and to-day, contrary
to custom, will be a half-holiday, that
the school may debate the question and conclude
upon it. I would point out that there
is no middle course here, in my opinion.
Either Ferrars must be forgiven after a public
apology to the establishment he has outraged,
or he must be expelled. As for the
money, if those who have lost it will apply
to me between one and two o’clock to-day,
each shall have his share again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, you may guess what a jaw there was
that afternoon; and finally, after hours of
talk, Slade decided the point must be arranged
by putting papers into a hat. If you
drew a cross on the paper it meant that you
wanted Ferrars to be expelled; and if you
drew a naught, that meant he was to be
let off. You were not bound to say how
you voted, and the excitement when the
votes were counted was something frightful.
Ferrars little knew what was going on.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last the numbers were read out:</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
<colgroup>
<col width='83%' />
<col width='16%' />
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <td class='c004'>For expulsion</td>
    <td class='c005'>124</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c004'>Against expulsion</td>
    <td class='c005'>101</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>And Slade and Bradwell were mad when
Slade read them, and said that Merivale
was disgraced. But Gideon and Butler
and Ashby major and Trelawny said not,
and thought it wasn’t a case for anything
but justice. The Doctor made no remark
when he heard what had happened, but I
heard him tell the new master, Thompson,
a day afterwards that perhaps the Lower
School ought not to have been allowed to
vote, as small boys would merely have understood
that Ferrars had stolen money and
nothing else. Their minds, the Doctor said,
were not big enough to take in the peculiar
nature of the case. But Thompson said he
honestly believed the school was perfectly
right, and that the subtleties of the case
were not for that court; and the Doctor
sighed and said it might be so.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anyway, Ferrars went. We never saw
him again, and the only cheerful thing
about the end of it was that Steggles was
badly scored off. You see he nipped off to
the Doctor among the first, and said Ferrars
had stolen ten shillings from him too. But
it happened that Ferrars had kept the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>careful account of all the money he had
raised for Mrs. Gouger and the people he
had raised it from. But he had never taken
a farthing from Steggles. So Steggles was
flogged by Mannering in his best form;
which shows that things which are frightfully
sad in themselves often produce fine
results in a roundabout sort of manner.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>The Buckeneers</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Of corse even a kid can get a good idea
sometimes, and Maine, who I was fagging
for, said afterwards that the idea was
alright. Whether young Bailey or me thort
of it first I don’t know, but Maine lent me a
book about coarseers and buckeneers and
such like people, and he said it was a great
life, though not much followed in present
times. He was no good for a coarseer himself,
becorse the sea always made him dredfully
bad, and, besides, he was going to be
a bushranger some day, being an Australian
and well up in it. But he said that Drake
and Raleigh and many other men in our
English history were buckeneers of the dedliest
sort and had made England what it was;
so me and Bailey thort a lot about it and
wished a good deal we could begin that sort
of life. Bailey said that in the books he’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>read, if a boy began young, he was generally
a super cargo and went on getting grater
and grater slowly; but I thort boys began as
cabin-boys and got grater very quickly by
resquing people. But Bailey said that was
only in books, and that nobody got on quickly
at sea owing to the compettitishun. He
did not much think there were any buckeneers
left, but Maine said there were, cheefly
off the coast of Africa, and that daring and
dedly deeds were done in the Mediterranan
to this day. He said the lawlessness there
was awful, and that nobodi knew what went
on along the north side of Africa in little
bays and inletts there not marked on maps.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Bailey herd that, he took more interest
in it and wished he had been born the
son of a pirit insted of a doctor, because he
said we should have come eesily to it if our
fathers had been in that corse of life; but
when I told Maine, he sed that the best and
most splendid pirits had had to overcome
grate dificultees in their youth, and that it
was the pirit who began as a meer boy at
school who often made the gratest name.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bailey sed he was a pirit at heart, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>sed I was to; but not untell we red a butiful
book by Stevenson could we see any way to
be one reelly. Then we saw that we must
go away from Merivale in secret--in fact,
we must fly; and Bailey sed it would have
to be by night to avoid capture, and Maine
sed it was so. But it was a tremendous
thing to do, and I asked Bailey about his
mother, and Bailey sed his mother would
blub a good deal at first, but she would live
to be proud of him when his name was
wringing through England. And I felt the
same in a way, becorse, though I have got
no mother to blub, I have got an uncle, who
is my gardian, and he is a lawer and a Conservitive
who has tried to get into Parleyment
and failed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then me and Bailey talked it out when
chaps were asleep in our dormitory, and the
thing was what we should reelly and truly
be, becorse there were coarseers and buckeneers
and pirits, and they all had their own
pekuliar ways. So we asked Maine which
was best, and he sed “buckeneers.” He
didn’t seem to know exacktly what a coarseer
was; but he told us all about pirits, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>he sed they kill womin and childrin, and
Bailey said he’d rather be a docter, like his
father, than do that, and I said the same.
But a buckeneer is very diferent, being like
Raleigh and Drake; and a buckeneer may
have his name wringing through England,
but a pirit never has, being rather a beast
reelly. Maine sed it was like this: a pirit
always thinks of himself, and nobody else;
but the best sort of buckeneer thinks of himself,
of corse, but thinks of his country to;
and after he has replennished his coffers he
makes his soverein a present of islands, and
so on, which are gennerally called after him,
so that his name may never be forgottun.
And Bailey sed that was the sort he wanted
to be, and I sed so to.</p>

<p class='c000'>We thanked Maine a good deal, and he
sed it was a big idea for such kids as us to
get, and hoped we were made of the right
stuff, and promised not to say a word to a
soul. And we finally desided to try it, and
Bailey sed we must have a plan of ackshun;
so we made one.</p>

<p class='c000'>He said we must run away and work
gradully by night to the coast and go to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Plymouth, and get into the docks, and find
a ship bound for the north coste of Africa.
I asked him what next, and he sed, very
truly, that that was enuff to begin with, and
that by the time we had done that much
manny adventures would have fallen to our
lot, and we might alredy be in the way to
become buckeneers. And I sed I hoped we
should make freends at sea; but he sed the
fewer freends we made the better buckeneers
we should probbably be, because it is not a
life where you can make freends safely. In
fact, no reel buckeneer would trust his own
brother a yard. And I sed that we must
trust one annuther at any rate. And Bailey
sed, as far as that went, he supposed we
must; but he sed it relluctantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The thing was then to save up for the
diferent weppons. Maine sed we shouldn’t
want arms, and that money was all we
should require till we got down south; but
Bailey felt sure we must at leest have pistells,
becorse in books the man armed to the
teath is never mollested if people know, but
the unarmed man often looses his life for
want of a weppon. We had one shilling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>pocket-money a week each, and Bailey getting
a birthday, very fortunately, made a
whole pound by it after we had been saving
for three weeks. So between us we suddinly
had one pound six shillings, and Bailey sed
it was share and share alike for the present,
and always would be unless some dedly
hatred sprang up between us. And I sed it
never would; but he sed it might, and if it
did, it would probabbly be about a girl if
books were true. And I larfed, becorse we
both have a grate contemp for all girls.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, things went alright, and on a half-holiday
we managed to get to Merivale and
buy pistells. They were five shillings and
sixpence each, and the man didn’t seem to
much like selling them; but we got them,
and amunition--fifty rounds each. And
Bailey sed that would be enough. Maine
sed they were very good pistells for close
work, but advised us never to use them
unless in soar straights. And we sed we
wouldn’t.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the day of the menaggeree at
Merivale that me and Bailey finally took
the grate step of going. We had collected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>a lot of food, and studdied geography so
as to get to Plymouth, and we arranged
that we should travel by night and hide
by day in the hart of impennetrable woods,
which we did. After the menaggeree, at a
certain point on the way home, we slipped
it round a corner, and Thompson didn’t
see us, and in a breef time we were at the
edge of Merivale Woods, free.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To-night,” Bailey sed, “we will get
across this forest and do eight or ten miles
along the high-road, and so reach Oakshott
Woods at dawn. They are on the edge
of the moor and quite impennetrable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So we got well into Merivale Woods first
and made a lair of braken under a fir-tree.
And we cut off some of the fir-tree bark
and licked the sap, which is very nourishing
and feeding, because we wanted to save
our food as much as possible. But we had
each a cold sorsage and a drink of water.
And then night came on, and I felt, for
the first time, that we had done a tremendous
deed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’re fairly started,” I sed to Bailey.
“It’s just call over at Merivale now.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>And he sed, “Yes; if the fellows in the
upper third could only see us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I sed, “It’s a small begenning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And he sed, “It is; but if things go
rite, and we are made of the propper stuff
for buckeneers, we’ll make England wring
yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then it began to rain rather hard, and
I found that a wood isn’t really a dry place
by night if it rains, and Bailey lighted a
match, and sed it was nearly nine.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’ll mean ‘lights out’ at Merivale,”
he sed; “but for us it’ll mean the begenning
of the night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I sneazed just about then, becorse water
from the fir-tree was dropping down my
neck rather fast, and Bailey sed if I was
going to get annything the matter with me
I had better go back at once, becorse no
buckeneer ever had a cold, being men of
steel and iron. And I sed a sneaze was
nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then we started very corsiously through
the wood, and Bailey cocked his pistell, and
I asked him kindly to walk in front, feeling
a curious sensashun when he walked behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>me with his pistell cocked. I told him, and
he sed it was fear, but I sed it was kaution.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes he whispered, “Cave!” and
we sunk down and got fritefully dripping
in the wet, but nothing happened, and we
were getting well on through the wood when
Bailey sed, “Cave!” again, and this time,
when we had sunk down, we distinkly herd
a footstep, and Bailey sed it was our first
adventure, and I sed I wished it had come
by daylight, becorse it wants grate practise
to face adventures in the dark at first.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anyway the noise got nearer and got
louder, and Bailey and me both cocked our
pistells, and he sed, “Reserve your fire to
close range,” and I sed, “Yes.” Then he
sed, “I see the thing. It’s bigger than
a beast you would expect in an English
wood”; and I sed, “I have got a sort of
fealing it is something out of the menaggerie”;
and he sed, “Then it will be a
real adventure, and I wish we were up
trees.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was to late, and something went
quite close. I sore a red spark, and Bailey
sed, “Fire!” which we did. At leest my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>pistell went off with fereful effect; but
Bailey’s didn’t, and he sed afterwards that
he’d make the pistell man biterly rew the
day he sold him a treecherous weppon.</p>

<p class='c000'>But after I fired we herd a human voice,
and it sed, “Hell!” Then it sed other
fearful words, which Bailey sed we ought
to remember because they were buckeneering
words curiously enuff. And then the
man dashed towards us, which showed I had
not slain him, or even hit him in a vittle
spot; and we fled, and soon we found that
we had distanced him, though we had a
squeek for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He was a keeper,” sed Bailey, “and he
will think we were poachers, and raise a
hue-and-cry. We must keep on and get
into Oakshott Woods, or we shall very likely
have to yield to supereer force.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After this eksitement I got a curious feeling
in my stomach, and telling Bailey, he
sed it was either hunger or fear. And I sed
it was hunger; but Bailey sed, seeing what
a hevy meal we had made with sorsage and
bred and turpentine juice only two hours
before, that it was fear.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>I sed if he thought so he’d better go on
without me, as I hadn’t taken to this corse
of life to be cheeked by him. And he sed
he was leeder of the gang, and I was the
gang, and the first thing was to lern to obey
orders. And then I got rather cross with
Bailey, and asked him who he thort he was
to give me orders, and reminded him my
pistell could go off anyway, which was more
than his could. This worried him a good
deal, becorse, of course, the man whose pistell
went off had the best of it. Then he
sed that it was no good having a quarrel
between ourselves while we were not yet out
of danger. He also said that he beleeved
we might venture to take one hour’s sleep
to strengthen us before getting on to Oakshott,
and I sed, “Yes,” but thought that
one of us ought to watch while the other
slept. Bailey said he would watch first, and
he sed also that we might get to the woodman’s
hut in the middle of Merivale Woods
if we kept on past a ded fir-tree with its
stem white, becorse all the bark was off,
which we did, becorse the moon was now
shining very britely, and the rain had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>stopped. The cold was also friteful, and
my teath chattered once or twice, but I
broke sticks and things to attract Bailey,
becorse if he had herd my teath he would
have sed it was fear again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once a bough jumped back and hit Bailey
a friteful smack in the face, and I was glad,
and he sed he rather thort his eye was done
for; and he sed it didn’t much matter if it
was, so long as he had one good eye to see
with, becorse most buckeneers lost an eye
sooner or later, though generally with a
stroak from a cutlass.</p>

<p class='c000'>We found the hut, and there was some
dry fern in it, and we lighted a candle-end
we had, and took off our boots, and wrung
out our socks, and each had half a currant
dumpling. Then Bailey looked at his watch
and sed I might turn in for half an hour.
Then he would wake me and turn in for
half an hour himself. He went on gard
with another candle-end, and advised me to
draw my pistell and sleep with it cocked
under my head. But I sed I never herd of
such a dangerous thing as that being done,
and kept my pistell reddy cocked near my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>hand. I didn’t fall off to sleep, as I expected,
owing to anxiaty as to our fate, but
I shut my eyes and thort a good deal, and
after my eyes had been shut some time I
opened one a little and was grately surprised
to see Bailey coming towards me steelthily.
He had his pistell in his hand, and first I
had a horrible thort he wanted to kill me,
so that he mite have all our food and money;
and then I felt sure he was coming to change
pistells, so that he might have the one that
went off. This made me get in a friteful
wax with him, becorse I saw he was very
unreliable and not reely as much of a chum
as I had thort. So I waited untill I saw him
stretch out his hand for my pistell, and
then I leapt at his throat in a very ferocious
way, that much surprized him. I
also sed “Hell!” like the keeper had.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must have been a solumn site by the
lite of the candle-end when we began to
fight tooth-and-nail for the pistell which
could go off. We were both desperet, and
it was reelly a battle to deside which should
be the leeder of the enterprise and which
should be merely the gang. Then, while we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>wresled and straned every nerve, a curious
thing happened, for we fell against the candle-end,
stuck on the top of a stick, and the
candle-end fell against the side of the hut,
and the hut, being made of wood, with walls
of dried heather, was very inflameable and
cort fire almost immediately.</p>

<p class='c000'>And then Bailey sed we must aggree to
settle our dispute later on and fli at once.
So we each took our own pistell, and were
just going to leave the scene, when, to our
grate horror, we herd voices, and among
them the voices of Browne and Mainwaring,
who were, of corse, house-masters at Merivale.</p>

<p class='c000'>Exhorsted though we were, me and Bailey
made a terrible effort to escape, and I think
we mite have done so even then, but, oweing
to the moon and two other men who
were with Mainwaring, we could not reach
an impennetrable part of the wood, and
finally Mainwaring cort me, and a man cort
Bailey, and they dragged us into the light of
the blazing ruins of the hut, and we found
out that Browne and Mainwaring had come
after us, like beestly blood-hounds, and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>met the keeper, who told them he had been
fired upon, and then the unfortunate burning
of the hut had directed their steps
towards us. And it’s a lesson in a way,
showing what risks it is for buckeneers to
fall out among themselves at kritikal moments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of corse we had to walk back merely
as prisoners of Mainwaring, but Bailey told
me not to answer questions and rather let
them cut our tongues out than know the
truth. So they didn’t get anything out of
us, and when we got back, at two o’clock in
the morning, Dunston was up to meet us;
and by that time, what with cold and bruises
and the failure of the skeem, I wasn’t equal
to defying Dunston, and merely sed we
wanted to change our corse of life for something
different, and had started to do so.
And I also sed that burning the hut was an
axsident which might have happened to anybody.
And Bailey sed the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Doctor Dunston sent for the matron,
and we had brandy-and-water and a hot
bath, which was very refreshing to me, but
Bailey sed biterly when he was in it that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>had thought that morning never to have had
a bath again. He also sed we should be
put in sepperate bedrooms that night, and
that if either of us got an opportunety to
eskape, it was his duty to reskue the other.
But I sed I didn’t want to eskape, being
fritefully sleepy and exhorsted, and I sed
that if he eskaped he needn’t trubble to
reskue me, becorse if I returned again to
being a buckeneer it certinnly wouldn’t be
with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>I didn’t see any more of him until next
day; then we were taken in like prisinners
of war before the school, and Doctor Dunston
lecktured upon us as if we were beests
of pray, and he sed that a corse of falty literatuer
was to blame for our running away,
and sed that the school liberary must be reformed.
But he never knew the grate truth,
becorse he sed we were onley running away
to sea becorse of the fascenation of the ocean
to the British karacter, when reely it was to
be buckeneers and the terrer of the Mediterranan.</p>

<p class='c000'>Maine showed us all the points we had
done wrong afterwards, and he sed the way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>we had fought for the best pistell was very
interesting to him and a grate warning not
to trust in your fellow-creetures. And, after
he had lecktured upon us, Doctor Dunston
flogged me and Bailey in publick, which
showed the stuff we were made of, becorse,
though Bailey gets very red when flogged,
he has never been known to shedd a tear;
and I get very white, curiously enuff; but
I have never been known to shedd a tear
either.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
